This directory supports building an ACL2 manual with the XDOC system.
However, instead of opening the resulting manual/index.html in your
browser, you might prefer to open the combined manual, which includes
documentation not only for the ACL2 system but also for the ACL2
community books.  The top-level Makefile in the books/ directory has
instructions for how to build that combined manual.

This directory contains files that allow you to produce the following:

manual/	    	      	    ; ACL2 manual as an XDOC document
rendered-doc.lisp	    ; ACL2 manual as ACL2 source file doc.lisp

Here is how to rebuild manual/, which is the ACL2 XDOC manual, where
the first step is optional:

  ../../clean.pl
  rm -rf manual acl2-manual.cert rendered-doc.lisp
  ../../cert.pl acl2-manual --acl2 <your_acl2>

To rebuild ACL2 source file doc.lisp to reflect the current contents
of acl2-doc.lisp:

  rm -f rendered-doc.lisp
  ../../cert.pl render-doc.lisp --acl2 <your_acl2>
  cp -p rendered-doc.lisp ../../../doc.lisp

Alternatively, you may accomplish both of the above by standing in the
ACL2 development directory, building ACL2, and then running:

  make DOC ACL2=<your_acl2>

Permanent contents of this directory:

README                      ; this file
acl2-customization.lsp
acl2-doc.lisp               ; ACL2 documentation (in XDOC format)
acl2-manual.lisp            ; certification creates manual/
cert.acl2
render-doc.lisp             ; certification creates rendered-doc.lisp
tool.tgz                    ; see below
unversioned-files-extra.txt ; svn support (see ../../README-svn)

File tool.tgz contains files that were used to create the initial
version of acl2-doc.lisp.  Moving forward, acl2-doc.lisp is to be
modified by hand by the ACL2 community (specifically, by members of
the acl2-books project).

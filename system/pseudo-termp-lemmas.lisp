(in-package "ACL2")

; This book is intented to only be included locally.  This is because we define
; a theorem whose consequence is (true-listp x).  This theorem won't typically
; apply, so we recommend including this book locally, so that the ACL2 rewriter
; won't be slowed down.

; Common mistakes when creating the books for verifying mutually recursive
; system functions similar to subst-expr, subst-var, etc., include:

; (1) Forgetting to call the flg function to recursively call itself instead of
;     the original functions.  This occurs because one tends to copy+paste the
;     body of the original functions into the flg function.

; (2) Not defining the *-preserves-len lemma.

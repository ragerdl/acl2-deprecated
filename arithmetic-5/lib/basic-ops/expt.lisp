;;; Note the form of the conclusion of these rules.  It is important
;;; to write type-prescription rules such that their conclusions
;;; actually specify a type-set.  Due to the presence of complex
;;; numbers and the fact that they are linearly ordered, 
;;; (< 0 (expt x n)) does not encode a type-set.  This makes me 
;;; unhappy at times.

;;; NOTE: Should the next 3 rules be :linear rules also?
;;; Since they compare to zero, probably not.  On the other hand, as
;;; noted above, type-reasoning is not always as good at
;;; determining the truth of inequalities as one might desire.  This is
;;; still true even with the improvement to type-set mentioned

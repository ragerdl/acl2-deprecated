 (:ABSTRACT "The books in this directory contain books for reasoning
about various data structures such as lists, alists, and sets.

Some of the books are documented in README, and others are not yet
documented.  TODO: Copy the documentation from README into this
Readme.lsp file, and document the undocumented books.

no-duplicates.lisp:  A simple but useful set of rewrite rules for
reasoning about NO-DUPLICATESP-EQUAL and INTERSECTP-EQUAL.

In this book, we explore if the reasoning of a VCG is complete.  In particular,
we are interested in the following question: If a program is totally correct,
is there always a VCG proof showing that it is totally correct?

The answer turns out to be "yes".  To prove this, assume that we have a proof
of partial correctness and also assume that we are given some cutpoints that
include the initial (i.e. pre) and final (i.e. exitpoint) states.  We then show
how to define the assertions so that we can derive the VCG obligations.

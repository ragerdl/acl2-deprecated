;; Parsimony tree scoring.

;; The two top-level functions are
;; (pscore-tree tree sequences cssl-map matrix) and
;; (pscore-trees trees sequences cssl-map matrix).

;; Arguments:

;; matrix - A cost matrix containing distances between (unambiguous)
;; nucleotides (or whatever states are used). This is an alist such that
;; (assoc-equal a matrix) equals the cost of a transition from a (the parent)
;; to each of n children where the nth child has a transition cost of (nth (cdr
;; (assoc-equal a matrix))).  Entries in the matrix need to be made in a
;; consistent order; i.e. all inner lists have the same order as the outer
;; alist.  We've defined the constant *dna-matrix* at the end of this file for
;; use with typical DNA sequences.

;; cssl-map - For dealing with ambiguous states.  A fast alist
;; which maps every character state, including ambiguous ones, to a list containing one
;; element (either 0 or nil for infinity) for each unambiguous state.  This
;; lets us answer the question "What is the cost of this subtree given that its
;; root is in state x" where x is some unambiguous state and the subtree is a
;; leaf.  If the state at the leaf is y (which may be ambiguous), we look up y
;; in the mapping.  This gives a list of 0s and nils, one for each unambiguous
;; state.  If x is the nth entry in matrix, the nth entry in this list gives
;; the cost of the subtree.  So if we are looking at DNA sequences (with
;; unambiguous states A C T G), and R is the symbol for the ambiguous state
;; which could be A or G, then the entry for R should be (0 nil nil 0).  The
;; unambiguous states should be present as well; for example, T should map to
;; (nil nil 0 nil).  *dna-scorelists* at the end of this file is an example 
;; for typical DNA sequences.

;; sequences - a fast alist mapping taxon names to sequences, each sequence
;; being a list of characters

;; tree - a tree in the typical TASPI form whose leaves are keys in sequences.

;; trees - a list of such trees.

;; (pscore-tree tree sequences cssl-map matrix) gives the parsimony score of
;; the given tree.

;; (pscore-trees trees sequences cssl-map matrix) gives a list containing the
;; parsimony scores of all the trees in the list.

(in-package "ACL2")
(include-book "costs")

;; The idea is that given a char-scorelist for each child node, we can
;; calculate the scorelist for the parent node: We need, for each character c and
;; state x, the cost contribution of c of the subtree rooted at the
;; parent given that c(parent) = x.  This value is
;; the sum over children a of
;;        the minimum over the states y of
;;                  the cost of the subtree rooted at a given c(a) = y
;;                      plus the cost of the transition from x to y.
;; We can get the char-scorelist for a leaf node by simply looking up each
;; state in the sequence in the scorelist-map (see make-leaf-score-list), and
;; we can get the final score for the tree from the char-scorelist for the root
;; node by summing the list of minima of its elements.

;; find-smallest-addition adds in the score contribution of one of the children
;; to the parent scorelist.  Doing this for all children results in the final
;; parent scorelist.

;; Finds the minimum of the subtree cost + transition cost given the list of
;; subtree costs and the list of transition costs.

;; add two scorelists returning smallest possible score
;; CurList is the scorelist at some child, and the translist is from
;; assuming we're transitioning to some particular character state at the
;; parent.  We are finding how much that transition would
;; cost for this subtree, essentially picking how to set the child charstate to
;; minimize the cost of the subtree given the parent assignment.

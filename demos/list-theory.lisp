; Written by David Rager with help from Shilpi Goel and Jared Davis.  

; Note that much of this information is probably available in book
; "std/util/deflist", but we have this simpler demo for more novice users.

; This book intends to introduce users into the typical lemmas needed when
; reasoning about functions whose arguments are true-listp's, but have some
; special property, like each element is a foo-p, as below.

; We could submit the following three lemmas, which would allow many of our

; This books demonstrates how we could model network communications between a
; client and server, and how we can interleave an attacker that would be a "Man
; in the middle" between the client and a server.  This file is the second of
; two that perform this modeling.  This file, network-state.lisp, is similar to
; the first, but it uses more advanced features of ACL2 (like defn,
; defaggregate, b*, guards, defun+ and its output signatures, etc.).

; The concepts in this book are based off David Rager's JFKr model, which can
; be found in books/security/jfkr.lisp and is explained in "An Executable Model
; for JFKr", which was included in the 2009 ACL2 Workshop.

; Copyright David Rager 2012.


; Suppose we have the following English description of a protocol.

; There are two actors, a client/initiator and a server/responder.  In this
; case, the server is providing a simple service -- it looks for a request on
; the network (presumably sent to the responder), squares the number included
; within the request, and sends the result back on the network.

; The server will keep track of the number of requests that it has served.


; The way we model state in this book is a reasonable model.  However, there
; are of course other ways that we could have done this.  The following two
; paragraphs are intended for a slightly more experienced reader, and the
; novice reader may wish to skip them.

; In this book, we have three states: the client state, the server state, and
; the network state.  One thing that could be different is that these three
; states could be combined into one single state.  Such a decision is a
; judgment call.  The current approach makes it clear to the reader that the
; server can not change the client state.  However, even if the client state
; was embedded in one single state (and we implemented such embedding
; correctly), ACL2 should easily be able to determine (prove) that the server
; does not change the client state.

; Another difference between this model and other models is that we sequence
; the client and server steps in a relatively manual fashion (see the uses of
; "b*" below).  We could model a greater variety of attacks if we had a single
; interpreter that took a state and a list that said what sequence of steps to
; run.  This interpreter would then run the sequence of steps on the state, and
; we could prove properties about the resulting sequence.  We could also
; underspecify the sequence of steps and still attempt to prove the same
; properties.  If those properties held, despite this less well-defined
; sequence of steps, we would have more assurance in the protocol.  One
; potentially interesting way to model picking the "next step" would be to have
; an "oracle" (for an example of an oracle that returns one of two values, see
; function foo in file nondeterminism.lisp, in this same directory) that could
; indicate whether the client, server, or attacker would get to take the next
; step.  We could then attempt to prove that given the oracle returns one of
; the three values each time the interpreter is called, if the :answer field in
; the client changes from :unknown, that the value for :answer must be the
; square of the client's :number-to-square.  Of course, this property isn't
; true of the protocol described and implemented in this file.  However, if we
; were to correctly add cryptographic functions (for example, encryption and
; signed hashes), we could perhaps create a protocol that had this property.

; This books demonstrates how we could model network state and an attacker that
; would be a "Man in the middle" between a client and a server.  This file is
; one of two that perform this modeling.  The second file, network-state.lisp,
; is similar to this file, but it uses more advanced features of ACL2 (like
; defn, defaggregate, etc.).

; The concepts in this book are based off Rager's JFKr model, which can be
; found in books/security/jfkr.lisp and is explained in "An Executable Model
; for JFKr", by David Rager, which was included in the 2009 ACL2 Workshop.

; Copyright David Rager 2012.


; Suppose we have the following english description of a protocol.

; There are two actors, a client/initiator and a server/responder.  In this
; case, the server is providing a simple service -- it looks for a request on
; the network (presumably sent to the responder), squares the number included
; within the request, and sends the result back on the network.

; The server will keep track of the number of requests that it has served.

This directory contains solutions to exercises of a tutorial nature.
In each case a solution is given that shows the process of arriving at
that solution.  A corresponding file ending with "-athena.lisp" is so
named because it appears to spring fully formed from nowhere: the
description of the process has been eliminated.

==============================

For the exercise in :doc introductory-challenge-problem-4:

introductory-challenge-problem-4.lisp
introductory-challenge-problem-4-athena.lisp

==============================

See equivalence-of-two-functions/README for a challenge problem to
prove equivalence of two recursively-defined functions.  Solutions may
be found in that directory.

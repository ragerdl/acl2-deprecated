; Goal: prove that (sum2 n n) equals (sum1 n).

; This didn't seem to me like an inductively-provable fact, I guess because in
; the inductive step, (sum2 n n) generates the term (sum2 (- n 1) n), which
; isn't an instance of (sum2 n n).  So I tried to think of how to express (sum2
; i j) in terms of sum1, where i and j aren't necessarily equal.

; Well, reading the definition, I can see that (sum2 i j) adds the numbers from
; (j - i) up to j, at least if i <= j.  That's the same as adding all the
; numbers from 0 to j, and then subtracting the numbers from 0 to (j - i - 1).
; That observation is realized in the next lemma, which failed to prove until I
; loaded an arithmetic library, as follows.

(defthm sum2-as-sum1
  (implies (and (natp i) (natp j) (<= i j))
           (equal (sum2 i j)
                  (- (sum1 j) (sum1 (1- (- j i)))))))

(defthm main
  (equal (sum2 n n)
         (sum1 n)))

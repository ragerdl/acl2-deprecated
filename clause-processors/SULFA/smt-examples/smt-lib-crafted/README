This directory contains some examples of SMT problems
in the SMT-LIB 32 bit, bit-vector format.

These were downloaded off the Internet from:

http://combination.cs.uiowa.edu/smtlib/

which also contains the official specification of the
SMT-LIB format.  Quoting from (a sub-page of) that page
and expanding a couple of links:

  Citing SMT-LIB

  To cite SMT-LIB as a whole the best for the moment would be to use something
  like the following:

  Silvio Ranise and Cesare Tinelli. The Satisfiability Modulo Theories Library
  (SMT-LIB), www.SMT-LIB.org. 2006.

  @MISC{RanTin-SMTLIB,
    author =	 {Silvio Ranise and Cesare Tinelli},
    title =	 {{The Satisfiability Modulo Theories Library (SMT-LIB)}},
    howpublished = {{\tt www.SMT-LIB.org}},
    year =	 2006,
  }

  To cite a publication on the the SMT-LIB format
  specifically, please use:

  Silvio Ranise and Cesare Tinelli. The SMT-LIB
  Standard: Version 1.2. Technical Report, Department
  of Computer Science, The University of Iowa,
  2006. (Available at www.SMT-LIB.org .)

  @TECHREPORT{RanTin-RR-06,
  author =	 {Silvio Ranise and Cesare Tinelli},
  title =	 {{The SMT-LIB Standard: Version 1.2}},
  institution =	 {Department of Computer Science, The University of
                  Iowa},
  year =	 2006,
  note =	 {Available at {\tt www.SMT-LIB.org}}
  }

The problems are part of the QF_UFBV32 benchmark suite.
They were contributed by Vijay Ganesh, and translated into
SMT-LIB format by Clark Barrett.

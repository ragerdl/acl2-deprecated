  :parents (top)
  :short "Libraries for reasoning about basic arithmetic, bit-vector

(defsection boolean-reasoning
  :parents (top)
  :short "Libraries related to representing and processing Boolean functions,
geared toward large-scale automatic reasoning, e.g., via SAT solving and AIG or
BDD packages."

  :long "<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_function'>Boolean
functions</a> are widely useful throughout mathematical logic, computer
science, and computer engineering.  In formal verification, they are especially
interesting because many high-capacity, fully automatic techniques are known
for analyzing, comparing, and simplifying them; for instance, see <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram'>binary decision
diagrams</a> (bdds), <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem'>SAT
solvers</a>, <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And-inverter_graph'>and-inverter
graphs</a> (aigs), <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking'>model
checking</a>, <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_equivalence_checking'>equivalence
checking</a>, and so forth.</p>

<h3>Libraries for Boolean Functions</h3>

<p>We have developed some libraries for working with Boolean functions, for
instance:</p>

<ul>

<li>@(see satlink) provides a representation of <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form'>conjunctive normal
form</a> formulas and a way to call SAT solvers from ACL2 and trust their
results.</li>

<li>Libraries like @(see aig) and @(see ubdds) provide @(see hons)-based AIG and
BDD packages.</li>

<li>@(see aignet) provides a more efficient, @(see stobj)-based AIG
representation similar to that used by <a
href='http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/'>ABC</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>These libraries are important groundwork for the @(see gl) framework for
bit-blasting ACL2 theorems, and may be of interest to anyone who is trying to
develop new, automatic tools or proof techniques.</p>

<h3>Libraries for Four-Valued Logic</h3>

<p>Being able to process large-scale Boolean functions is especially important
in @(see hardware-verification).  But actually, here, to model certain circuits
and to implement certain algorithms, it can be useful to go beyond Boolean
functions and consider a richer logic.</p>

<p>You might call Boolean functions or Boolean logic a two-valued logic, since
there are just two values (true and false) that any variable can take.  It is
often useful to add a third value, usually called X, to represent an
\"unknown\" value.  In some systems, a fourth value, Z, is added to represent
an undriven wire.  For more on this, see @(see why-4v-logic).</p>

<p>We have developed two libraries to support working in four-valued logic.  Of
these, the @(see 4v) library is somewhat higher level and is generally simpler
and more convenient to work with.  It serves as the basis of the @(see esim)
hardware simulator.  Meanwhile, the @(see faig) library is a bit lower-level
and does not enjoy the very nice @(see 4v-monotonicity) property of @(see
4v-sexprs).  On the other hand, @(see faig)s are closer to @(see aig)s, and can
be useful for loading expressions into @(see aignet) or @(see satlink).</p>

The files in this directory contain the events that appear in the
book.  For example, the functions defined here do not have guards.
This directory may be useful for someone who wants to do the
exercises, but does not want to type in the functions presented in the
chapter.  In addition, this directory may be useful for someone who
wants to experiment with ACL2 while reading the the book.  Eventually,
you will want to look at the "solutions" directory which contains
proofs and guards (and their verification).  See "../README" for more
information.

Because the definitions of some functions depend on solutions to
exercises, some exercise solutions are included (although not noted as
such) in the files in this directory.

You can use "cert.pl" to certify these books.

;; DEADLOCK FREEDOM FOR CIRCUIT SWITCHING
;;----------------------------------------
;; The proof is structured as follows:
;; 1.) We define a property P which implies deadlockfreedom
;; 2.) We proof P implies a possible route
;; 3.) We prove P is preserved by GeNoC, i.e., if
;;     it holds, then after one GeNoC-cycle it still holds.
;; 4.) We prove P implies en route is empty, by proving that
;;     scheduling always provides a legal measure.
;; 5.) We prove that if en route is empty, then arrived is full.
;;
;; Property P is defined as:
;; (and ---the nodeset doesn't contain nil---
;;      (not (member-equal nil nodeset))
;;      ---each node has *num-of-buffers* buffers---
;;      (buffersize ntkstate *num-of-buffers*)
;;      ---trlst has no travel whose frm is nil---
;;      (not (member-equal nil (V-Frms trlst)))
;;      ---the trlst is created by xy routing---
;;      (trlst-created-by-xy-routing trlst nodeset)
;;      ---trlst is a valid travel list---

 ;; deadlockfree_v returns nil if the given travel
 ;; is or will be in deadlockstate and t otherwise.
 ;;
 ;; Parameters:
 ;; v: the travel that is currently checked
 ;; v-acc: an accumulator of travels already examined
 ;; trlst: the complete initial trlst
 ;; ntkstate: the network state
 ;;
 ;; A given travel v is deadlockfree if either
 ;; 1.) each node of the route has empty buffers
 ;; 2.) the travels that fill the nodes of the route are deadlockfree.
 ;; If while checking the second condition v must again be checked, a cycle is encountered
 ;; and thus v is in deadlockstate. Therefor the travels are accumulated in v-acc.
 ;;
 ;; From a computational point of view, this function can be much more effective.
 ;; First, instead of checking al travels in a route with A-deadlockfree_v, it
 ;; suffices to check if for all nodes in route there exists a travel that is deadlockfree.
 ;; However, for such function E-deadlockfree_v, we can't prove the needed theorem
 ;; subsetp-preverves-E-deadlockfree_v, because the witness can be outside the subset.
 ;; Secondly, it is sufficient to check only full nodes, since a non-full node can't
 ;; cause deadlock. This would increase complexity of the proof.
 ;; Thirdly, the function could check, before it enters recursion, whether the rest of
 ;; the route is free, and not go into recursion if so. Again this would increase
 ;; complexity of the proof.
 ;;
 ;; The measure is a list of four elements, lexicographically compared:
 ;; it is possible (but shouldn't occur) that v is not in the trlst. However this can occur
 ;; only with the first call, since get-travels returns travels from trlst (see the previous
 ;; theorem). The first element is 1 if v is not in trlst, and if so, decreases to 0 after the
 ;; first call. The same holds for travels of A-deadlockfree_v. Thus for correct input the
 ;; first element is always 0.
 ;; The second element decreases on each call of A-deadlockfree_v in deadlockfree_v and remains
 ;; equal on each call of deadlockfree_v in A-deadlockfree_v.
 ;; The third element decreases on each call of deadlockfree_v in A-deadlockfree_v.
 ;; The fourth element is the `self' decreasing measure: for deadlockfree_v this is constant
 ;; since it's non-recursive. For A-deadlockfree_v this is the length of travels, since this
 ;; decreases on each self-call.

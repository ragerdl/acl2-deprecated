;; this file is similar to the one in the ACL2 book library the 
;; differences are 
;; some extra theorems at the end.
;; and the main difference is the change in the permutation function
;; to use member-equal instead of the function in used in the books.
;; But apart from that it is the same as the one in the ACL2 distribution

After certifying "gauss", you can run the program in ACL2, for example
as follows.

(include-bonok "gauss")
(acl2-loop (s* :input1 10000))
(g :asn (acl2-top-inv (s* :input1 10000)))

Note that we have done a few hand-edits to create this directory:

- Deleted initial ACL2s preamble comment from gauss-fns.lisp and
  gauss-work.lisp
- Deleted unnecessary add-include-book-dir, :dir, and include-books
  forms from gauss-fns.acl2, gauss-work.acl2, and gauss-work.lisp
- Copied preliminaries.{acl2,lisp} and generic-loop-inv.lisp from
  another directory

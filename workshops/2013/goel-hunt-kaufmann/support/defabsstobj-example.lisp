; A nice convention, observed below, is to use the suffixes "$c" and "$a" to
; suggest "concrete" and "abstract" for the concrete and abstract stobjs,
; respectively, that will be used in our defabsstobj event.

; We begin by defining a concrete stobj, with two fields: a memory of 100
; natural number values (initially 100 zeroes), and a ``miscellaneous'' field
; initialized to 0.

(defstobj st$c
  (mem$c :type (array t (100))
         :initially 0)
  misc$c)

; We next introduce the logical recognizer for the MEM-MAP component of the
; abstract stobj, to serve as an alternate implementation of memory based on an
; association list.  Just for fun, we add an invariant beyond what is required
; of the concrete stobj: all memory values are even natural numbers.

(defun mem-map$ap (x)
  (declare (xargs :guard t))
  (cond ((atom x) (null x))
        ((atom (car x)) nil)
        (t (and (natp (caar x)) (< (caar x) 100) ; index is in range
                (natp (cdar x)) (evenp (cdar x))
                (mem-map$ap (cdr x))))))

; Now we define a recognizer for the abstract stobj.  Note that in general, an
; abstract stobj needn't have ``fields'' in the sense that a concrete stobj has
; fields.  Instead, there is a recognizer for the abstract stobj, a creator for
; making an initial object, and exported functions for reading and writing the
; object.  We begin by defining the recognizer.  In our simple example, it is
; convenient to think of two ``fields'' but, just to add a bit of interest, in
; the opposite order from their order in the concrete stobj.

; To make things interesting, we use an entirely different shape for our
; abstract stobj than for our concrete stobj.  Here we use a cons whose cdr is
; the memory.

(defun st$ap (x)
  (declare (xargs :guard t))
  (and (consp x)
       (mem-map$ap (cdr x))))

; We next define read and write functions for our abstract stobj, first for the
; MISC component and then for the memory.

(defun misc$a (st$a)
  (declare (xargs :guard (st$ap st$a)))
  (car st$a))

(defun update-misc$a (v st$a)
  (declare (xargs :guard (st$ap st$a)))
  (cons v (cdr st$a)))

(defun lookup$a (k st$a)
  (declare (xargs :guard (and (natp k)
                              (< k 100)
                              (st$ap st$a))))
  (let* ((mem-map (cdr st$a))
         (pair (assoc k mem-map)))
    (if pair (cdr pair) 0)))

(defun update$a (k val st$a)
  (declare (xargs :guard (and (st$ap st$a)
                              (natp k) (< k 100)
                              (natp val) (evenp val))))
  (cons (car st$a)
        (put-assoc k val (cdr st$a))))

; Our next task is to define a required function, which we call st$corr, that
; defines a correspondence relation between our concrete and abstract stobjs.
; This relation is used in the proof obligations that follow.  Since this
; relation is of logical interest only, we avoid guards and guard verification.

(defun corr-mem (n st$c st$a) ; auxiliary to st$corr, defined below
  (declare (xargs :stobjs st$c :verify-guards nil))
  (cond ((zp n) t)
        (t (let ((i (1- n)))
             (and (equal (mem$ci i st$c) (lookup$a i st$a))
                  (corr-mem i st$c st$a))))))

(defun st$corr (st$c st$a)
  (declare (xargs :stobjs st$c :verify-guards nil))
  (and (st$cp st$c)
       (st$ap st$a)
       (equal (misc$c st$c) (misc$a st$a))
       (corr-mem 100 st$c st$a)))

; Next we define the function that creates our abstract stobj.

(defun create-st$a ()
  (declare (xargs :guard t))
  (cons nil nil)) ; (cons misc mem)

; At this point we execute our defabsstobj event in order to get proof
; obligations, pasted into the file below as shown in CAPITAL LETTERS.
; If you think about the expected proof obligations, you might be surprised to
; find that MISC{GUARD-THM} and UPDATE-MISC{GUARD-THM} are missing (analogous
; to other {GUARD-THM} lemmas).  ACL2 notices that these missing ones hold
; trivially, and spares us the trouble of considering them.

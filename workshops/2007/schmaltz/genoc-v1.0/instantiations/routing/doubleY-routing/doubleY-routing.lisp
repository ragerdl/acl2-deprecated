;; modeling of an adaptive routing algorithm
;; we consider a 2D-mesh. We compute all possible minimal paths
;; between two nodes.
;; The algorithm is an interleaving of XY and YX. 

; JSM - August, 2011: This file contains one or more occurrences of
; (:executable-counterpart tau-system) added when the Tau System was
; implemented on top of Version_4.3.  Some occurrences may have been commented
; out but left to mark the locations of changes made necessary because of the
; tau literal deletion problem described in the Essay on Tau-Clause -- Using
; Tau to Prove or Mangle Clauses.  When tau was no longer allowed to delete
; literals, those disablings of tau-system were no longer required.

;;-------------------------------------------------------------

;; in this algorithm, at each node two paths are possible, along the X or the Y axis.
;; We model it as the alternative application of the xy and the yx algorithms.
;; We compute all possible minimal paths between any pair of nodes.
;; Note that for all nodes that share one coordinate with a destination, 
;; there is no choice: the shortest path is to travel along the opposite axis. 
;; For a given source node s, all possible routes obtained by first 
;; applying the xy algorithm are computed by (a) r = xy(s,d), 
;; (b) applying yx for all nodes of r that do not share 
;; a coordinate with d, (c) for all such routes, applying the xy algorithm to 
;; each node that do not share a coordinate with d, ...

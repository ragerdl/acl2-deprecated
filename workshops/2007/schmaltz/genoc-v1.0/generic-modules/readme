1 Structure of the books for GeNoC
-----------------------------------

1.1 GeNoC-types 
--------------
	
	This book defines the data types used in GeNoC: transactions, 
missives, travels, etc. It contains basic functions used to manipulate
these datatypes. 
	It does not import any book.

1.2 GeNoC-misc
--------------

	This book imports GeNoC-types.
	This book contains miscellaneous definitions. For instance, it 
defines predicates like CorrectRoutep, the filtering operator extrac-sublst,
some lemmas about subsetp, etc.

1.3 GeNoC-nodeset
-----------------

	This book contains functions about the definition and the validation 
of the set of the existing nodes of a particular network. 
	It does not import any book.

1.4 GeNoC-routing
-----------------

	This book imports GeNoC-nodeset and GeNoC-misc.
	It contains functions about the definition and the validation 
of the routing algorithm. 

1.5 GeNoC-scheduling
--------------------

	This book imports GeNoC-misc and GeNoC-nodeset.
	It contains functions about the scheduling policy of GeNoC. It
also adds some lemmas used in the final proof. These lemmas link 
functions like extract-sublst, missivesp, etc. They are about NodeSet
and this is why we need the corresponding book.

1.7 GeNoC-interfaces
--------------------

	This book contains functions about the definition and the validation
of the interfaces. 
	It does not import any book.

1.7 GeNoC
---------
	This book imports the previous books. It contains the definition 
of GeNoC and its proof of correctness. 

1.8 Global Structure
--------------------

	The global "book tree" is the following:

                                 GeNoC
			/         | 	          \ 
       GeNoC-scheduling    GeNoC-routing       GeNoC-interfaces
         |          |      |          | 	
 GeNoC-nodeset     GeNoC-misc     GeNoC-nodeset
                       |
                   GeNoC-types

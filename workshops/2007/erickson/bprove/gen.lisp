; t or nil according to whether term1 occurs in term2 but neither it
; nor any of its subterms is collectable.  This latter condition is
; said to be the ``potential'' of term1 participating in a collection
; vicariously.  What does that mean?  Suppose a1, ..., an, all have
; potential.  Then none of them are collected (because they aren't

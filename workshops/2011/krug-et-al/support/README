y86: Our Y86 model is based on one from Warren A. Hunt, Jr.

make: A "make" script.

id-pt: A set of functions to test creating an identity page table.

asm: A Y86 assembler.

NOTE: These proofs were done with an eye towards completing a
preliminary version, rather than with an eye towards maintainability.
It may be best, if there are regression failures, simply to use
skip-proofs where needed rather than devoting significant time towards
fixing failed proofs.  Moreover, certification of
MinVisor/setup-nested-page-tables.lisp took over an hour and 38
minutes on an "Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E31280 @ 3.50GHz", a very fast
machine as of November, 2011.

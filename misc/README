This directory contains a bunch of ACL2 books that were created over the
years at CLI.  They don't have any relation to each other; this is
really a grab-bag.

===============================================================================

Installation

The makefile and other files all assume that this library is installed in the
local directory that exists in the ACL2 source distribution, i.e., that `..'
is the main directory of ACL2 books, and ../data-structures is the
data-structures library directory.  If for some reason you move this
directory away from here, things will start to break.

To certify all books type

% make all

to certify all books with the ACL2 image "acl2", assuming that the underlying
Lisp creates object files with .o extensions.  You can also do

% make all ACL2=<acl2-image>

defp.lisp   -- define partial functions using defp
defpun.lisp -- define partial functions using defpun

The book defpun.lisp books provides a macro, defpun, by which you can
introduce certain tail-recursive function ``definitions'' that do not
always terminate.  The book defp.lisp provides a more powerful macro,
defp, which is built on top of defpun but allows more general forms of
tail recursion than does defpun.

Details of defpun are provided by Manolios and Moore in ``Partial Functions in
ACL2'' http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/defpun/index.html

===============================================================================

dft.lisp    -- write proofs in a sort of familiar style using dft macro
dft-ex.lisp -- examples of use of dft book

The book dft defines a macro named dft (a named derived from DeFThm).  The book
dft-ex illustrates the macro with a few simple arithmetic proofs.  Basically,
the macro allows you to write proofs in a sort of familiar style.  Here is a
simple example:

(dft comm2-test-1
     (equal (* a (* b c)) (* b (* a c)))
     :rule-classes nil
     :otf-flg nil
     :proof
     ((consider (* a (* b c)))
      (= (* (* a b) c))
      (= (* (* b a) c) :disable (associativity-of-*))
      (= (* b (* a c)))))

Each line in the :proof generates a lemma and at the end all the lemmas
are assembled to prove the main theorem in a pretty empty theory.  You can
see how this is actually done by using :trans1 on the dft command,

ACL2 !>:trans1 (dft comm2-test-1 ...)

and looking at the output.  The second book contains a few more interesting
examples, e.g., of case analysis and other things.  There is no documentation,
but perhaps the examples will help some.

===============================================================================

equal-by-g.lisp -- a generic theorem for proving that records (in the sense of
the misc/records book) are equal, by showing that any arbitrary field has the
same value in both records.

===============================================================================

evalable-printing.lisp -- a
"beginner-friendly" way of printing objects such that evaluating the
printed result gives that same result

See also ../hacking/evalable-ld-printing.lisp, which prints LD results
in "evalable" way, as provided by "evalable-printing" book.  To
activate, include this book and assign a non-nil value to the state
global EVALABLE-LD-PRINTINGP, as in (assign evalable-ld-printingp t).

===============================================================================

expander.lisp     --   symbolic expansion utilities for ACL2
dump-events.lisp  --   file-dumping utility for ACL2

See also simplify-defuns.lisp for a related tool.

These books contains various experimental symbolic expansion programs for
ACL2, and an event dumping utility.  This stuff can really be helpful when
doing a big project with ACL2.  In expander.lisp the documented macros are
SYMSIM and DEFTHM?.  In dump-events.lisp, see the documentation for
DUMP-EVENTS. 

Unfortunately, the real-world examples of the uses of these utilities are in
proprietary proofs, so all we will do here is give a few hints.  The idea was
to save time in large proofs by using DEFTHM? to pre-compute the reduced
expansions of complex functions.  We used DEFTHM? to write theorems of the
form (EQUAL (HAIRY-FN ...) (... <expanded and reduced body> ...)).  We then
used DUMP-EVENTS to dump the lemmas produced by DEFTHM? to a file, which was
then certified. 

===============================================================================

fast-coerce.lisp -- a replacement for coerce, which speeds up (coerce x 'list)

This just providse the function fast-coerce, which is a drop-in replacement
for coerce and is faster at converting strings to lists.

===============================================================================


fibonacci.lisp -- a thm. on the Fibonacci sequence and greatest common divisor
-- Supporting books: --
int-division.lisp
grcd.lisp

The main theorem main-grcd-fib states that if fib(i) is the ith Fibonacci
number and grcd is the greatest common divisor function, then for positive
integers n and k, grcd(fib(k), fib(n)) = fib(grcd(k,n)).

===============================================================================

file-io.lisp -- utilities for reading and writing files

(read-list fname ctx state) returns (mv nil lst state) where lst is the list
of top-level forms in the file named fname.  Except, if there is an error
then (mv t nil state) is returned.

(write-list list fname ctx state) pretty-prints the given list of forms to
file fname, except that strings are printed without any formatting.

===============================================================================

find-lemmas.lisp -- utility for finding relevant lemmas

(Find-lemmas (fn1 fn2 ...)) returns all lemmas in which all of the indicated
function symbols occur, except those lemmas in the ground-zero world.  In
order to include those as well, give a second argument of nil:
(find-lemmas (fn1 fn2 ...) nil).

If fns is a symbol, then fns is replaced by (list fns).

===============================================================================

gentle.lisp -- analogues of known functions with weaker guards (often, T)

===============================================================================

getprop.lisp -- user-managed fast property lists

===============================================================================

meta-lemmas.lisp  --  meta-lemmas for nth and member

This book simply provides 2 meta-lemmas.  The first, REDUCE-NTH-META-CORRECT,
quickly reduces NTH applied to formal proper lists, e.g.,

(NTH 2 (CONS x (CONS y (CONS z NIL)))) ==> z.

The second, REDUCE-MEMBER-META-CORRECT, quickly transforms MEMBER applied to
EQLABLE-LISTP constants to nested IFs, e.g.,

(MEMBER x '(:MEDIUM LARGE)) ==> (IF (EQL x :MEDIUM) '(:MEDIUM :LARGE)
                                    (IF (EQL x :LARGE) '(:LARGE)
                                        NIL)),

which is propositionally equivalent to (OR (EQL x :MEDIUM) (EQL x :LARGE)).

correctly implements multiplication.

===============================================================================

oprof.lisp -- simple performance profiling tool for OpenMCL

This book only works on the OpenMCL-based version of ACL2.  It implements a 
simple performance profiler that allows you to see which functions are taking
the most time during some computation.  See the comments inside this book for 
usage instructions and examples.  Also note that this book uses a ttag, so to
include it you will need to run something like this:
  (include-book "misc/oprof" :dir :system :ttags '(oprof)).

===============================================================================

records.lisp   --  canonical key-value record structures
records0.lisp  --  canonical key-value record structures

These books provide similar functionality, though the approaches differ; the
history is given below.  Their purpose is to make it convenient to reason about
finite functions, which we call "record structures" and can be thought of as
(finite) lists of field-value pairs.  Why not simply use association lists?
Imagine for example starting with the empty record (function), then associating
'a with 1 and then 'b with 2.  Presumably the result would be '((b . 2) (a
. 1)).  But if the updates were done in the other order, then the result would
presumably be '((a . 1) (b . 2)).  Sometimes it is convenient to have only one
"canonical" representation for a finite function.  The record books provide
such a representation, as explained in comments near the top.

Rob Sumners originally created a book of record structures such that two such
structures with the same field-value associations are equal.  However, exported
lemmas required hypotheses that the structures were well-formed.

Matt Kaufmann eliminated the need for such hypotheses.  Instead, all that was
necessary was that the fields are symbols.  Matt posted this problem to the
acl2 mailing list, and Matt WIlding also came up with such a solution (not
included here).

Meanwhile, Pete Manolios was pushing for a total order on the ACL2 universe,
and he created events for such a purpose.  Ultimately, built-in ACL2 function
lexorder was made a total order, and Pete's events were modified to use
lexorder.  The result is total-order.lisp (documented in brief below).

Rob Sumners subsequently made some modifications to Matt Kaufmann's book,
primarily by using the total-order book to eliminate hypotheses that keys are
symbols.  The result is essentially records0.lisp.

Later, Rob came up with an alternate, simpler approach to providing the same
exported theorems.  The result is records.lisp.

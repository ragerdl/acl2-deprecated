; This file has been saved using the utf-8 character encoding.  As a result,
; the constant below has length 2 when using ACL2, which fixes the character
; encoding at iso-8859-1 (see :DOC character-encoding).  If the length of this
; constant is 1, then this file was probably saved with a different encoding,
; quite possibly iso-8859-1.

; WARNING: Before saving this file in emacs, evaluate the following form to set
; the indicated buffer-local variable, especially if you have loaded
; distributed file emacs/emacs-acl2.el into your emacs session, since that file
; sets the character encoding to iso-8859-1.

; (setq save-buffer-coding-system 'utf-8)

; If you have not done this, then in a linux shell, executing
;   cat character-encoding-test.lisp
; may show clearly that the string below has a single character.

; We have considered defining a function test-1 in file
; character-encoding-test.acl2, with the same body as test-2 below.  However,
; in SBCL 1.0.49 we found that our attempt to set the external format to
; iso-8859-1 (see function acl2-set-character-encoding in the ACL2 sources) did
; not affect reading directly from standard input.  Since .acl2 files are
; indeed read that way using the standard ACL2 makefile approach, SBCL was
; reading that .acl2 file in utf-8 format.  So we have abandoned the use of a
; .acl2 file and restricted ourselves just to the file-based test below.

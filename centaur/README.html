<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The <i>Centaur Books</i> are
a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> set of
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/">ACL2</a>
libraries for formal hardware verification.</p>

<p>They include:</p>

<ul>

<li><b>VL</b> &mdash; a Verilog parser and simplification tool.</li>

<li><b>E</b> &mdash; a deeply embedded hardware description language with a
well-defined semantics.</li>

<li><b>ESIM</b> &mdash; a symbolic simulator for E modules.</li>

<li><b>GL</b> &mdash; a symbolic simulator for ACL2 functions and framework for
bit-blasting ACL2 theorems.</li>

<li>Many supporting libraries, e.g., for representing Boolean or four-valued
logic expressions, debugging ESIM runs with waveforms, reasoning about
arithmetic, and so forth.</li>

</ul>

<p><a href="http://www.centtech.com/">Centaur Technology</a> is a small company
in Austin, TX.  We
design <a href="http://www.via.com.tw/en/products/processors/">x86
processors</a> for our parent company, <a href="http://www.via.com.tw/">VIA
Technologies</a>.  We have used these books to prove correctness properties of
several execution units, and to develop other tools such as an equivalence
checker, a linter, etc.


<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p><b style="color: #ff0000;">Warning:</b> We expect these books to be much
less stable than ordinary ACL2 books because we are actively using them and
often need to extend them.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Recommended Hardware</dt>

<dd>You probably want at least a <b>dual-core</b> machine with <b>8 GB</b> of
memory.</dd>

<dd>You might even want more memory than this.  Having ample memory is
especially important when you want to carry out proofs using BDDs.  Many of our
real hardware proofs are made faster (or possible) by having 32 or more GB of
memory.  Even things like our Verilog parser are written in a memory-hungry way
because that's just the kind of environment we work in.</dd>

<dd>Having additional cores is very useful for certifying books in parallel.</dd>


<dt>Recommended Operating System</dt>

<dd>We use <b>64-bit Linux</b>.  It might be possible to use Darwin or BSD or
other unixes instead, but Linux is the main platform.  You will need the
typical tools like perl, make, etc.</dd>


<dt>Clozure Common Lisp Configuration</dt>

<dd>We use 64-bit <a href="http://ccl.clozure.com/">Clozure Common Lisp</a>.
Other Lisps probably won't work.</dd>

<dd>We usually use a fairly recent SVN snapshot.</dd>

<dd>We use <a href="ccl-config.lsp">ccl-config.lsp</a> to do some extra
configuration that increases the stack sizes and tunes the garbage
collector for better performance.</dd>

<dd>We configure our <tt>PATH</tt> so that we can launch CCL by
typing <tt>ccl</tt>.</dd>


<dt>ACL2(h) Configuration</dt>

<dd>You will need to
build <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/">ACL2</a> with Hons
enabled.  The recommended way to build is with:</dd>

<dd><pre>make LISP=ccl ACL2_HONS=h ACL2_SIZE=3000000</pre></dd>

<dd>Using a large <tt>ACL2_SIZE</tT> can help avoid performance problems due to
filling up the ACL2 package with too many symbols.</dd>

<dd>We generally configure our <tt>PATH</tt> so that we can launch ACL2(h) by
typing <tt>acl2</tt>.</dd>


<dt>cert.pl Configuration</dt>

<dd>We use <tt>cert.pl</tt> instead of Makefiles.  This script is located in
the <tt>acl2/books</tt> directory.  We recommend that you configure
your <tt>PATH</tt> so you can invoke it by just typing <tt>cert.pl</tt>.</dd>


<dt>GTKWave Configuration (Optional)</dt>

<dd>We often use <a href="http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/">GTKWave</a> for
debugging waveforms.  Other VCD file viewers may also work.</dd>

<dd>We configure our <tt>PATH</tt> so that we can run GTKWave by
typing <tt>gtkwave</tt>.</dd>

</dl>


<h3>Building the Centaur Books</h3>

<p>Once you have all the above prerequisites, you will be ready to certify the
Centaur books.</p>

<p>To build all of the books and all available documentation, you should be able
to run the following command in the <tt>acl2/books/centaur</tt> directory:</p>

<pre>
cert.pl doc.lisp -j 4       # -j 4 for a quad-core processor
</pre>

<p>Depending on your hardware this may take ten minutes up to hours.</p>


<h3>Next Steps</h3>

<p>The <tt>cert.pl</tt> command above should produce a <b>reference manual</b>
with documentation for the Centaur books.  The manual also has all of the
regular documentation for ACL2 and also for several other libraries that we
use, e.g., str, osets, ihs, etc.</p>

<p>To view the manual, point your web browser
at <a href="manual/preview.html">books/centaur/manual/preview.html</a>.  (Note:
this will be a broken link until you generate the manual.)  You can also build
an HTML version of the manual that may render faster, see the documentation for
XDOC for more information.</p>

<p>There is also a very preliminary <b>tutorial</b> that walks through the
verification of a trivial ALU module.  To get started, see:</p>

<pre>
books/centaur/tutorial/intro.lisp
</pre>

<h3>Contact Information</h3>

<p>If you have questions, comments, or bug reports about these books, please
email Jared Davis and Sol Swords, <tt>{jared,sswords}@centtech.com</tt>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we can't offer any serious technical support.  We may be able
to answer some questions on an informal, "low bandwidth" basis, in our spare
time.</p>

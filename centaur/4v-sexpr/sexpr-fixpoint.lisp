; Sneaky Loop Debugging
;
; SEXPR-FIXPOINTS can perform poorly when there are apparent combinational
; loops.  Unfortunately, it can be very difficult to figure out where the loops
; are being encountered.  To assist with debugging these loops, we now
; automatically detect and print information about the looping signals.
;
; To avoid complicating the logical story by passing around inv-varmap and the
; loops we've found, we use the sneaky-load stuff for this.  Our real debugging
; code abuses sneaky-mutate to use it to print our debugging info.  But we
; won't install our debugging by default, so that this file doesn't need to
; depend on elaborate VL stuff that we use to make the debugger better.  See
; sexpr-loop-debug.lisp for the real debugger.

; The fixpoint algorithm is adapted from faig-least-fixpoint.lisp.  We leave
; the semantics uninterpreted for now.
;
; The top-level function is:
;
;    (SEXPR-FIXPOINT-WITH-VARMAP UPDATE-FNS VARMAP)
;
; Here,
;
;    UPDATE-FNS is an alist binding some signal names (atoms) to s-expressions
;    representing their update functions.
;
;    VARMAP is a 1-1 mapping from singal names to natural numbers.  It must
;    provide a binding for every key in the update-fns alist, and also for any
;    variables mentioned in any s-expression in the update-fns alist.
;
; We produce a new alist where every variable in UPDATE-FNS is bound to an
; S-Expression that represents its value after running all of the update
; functions until a fixed point is reached.
;
; The point of the VARMAP is to provide a translation from S-Expressions that
; involve arbitrary variables to S-Expressions that only involve natural-number
; variables.  We can compute the 4v-sexpr-vars of these "nat var sexprs" much more
; efficiently than for regular sexprs; see nat-var-sexprs.lisp for details.
;
; Indeed, our top-level function is nothing more than a wrapper which:
;
;    (1) rewrites the UPDATE-FNS using the VARMAP, producing some
;        NAT-UPDATE-FNS where all the signal names are natural numbers
;
;    (2) applies an auxilliary function to these NAT-UPDATE-FNS, which computes
;        all of the fixpoints in terms of these numbered variables.
;
;    (3) rewrites the resulting fixpoints using the inverse of VARMAP in order
;        to get fixpoint functions that are in terms of the original variables.
;
; Each rewriting pass is only O(n) in the size of the update-fns, and as such
; is relatively cheap.
;
;
; From now on, suppose we are working with natural variabled UPDATE-FNS.  The
; auxilliary function in step 2 can also be regarded as our top-level function
; for finding fixpoints of these kinds of update-fns, and is:
;
;    (SEXPR-FIXPOINTS UPDATE-FNS)
;
; It returns a new alist that binds the signal names to their final
; S-Expressions.  This function also operates in two phases:
;
;    (1) we try to topologically sort the update functions into a good order
;        that will minimize the number of backward-propagations needed in the
;        core algorithm, then
;
;    (2) we apply our core algorithm to the reordered update functions.
;
; The sorting phase is carried out by SEXPR-DFS, which (BOZO which presumably
; stands for "depth first search" or "depth first sort") and is not
; particularly tricky.
;
;
; The real core of the algorithm is:
;

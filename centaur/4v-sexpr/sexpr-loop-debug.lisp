; This file is a plug-in debugging mechanism for loops in the sexpr-fixpoint
; algorithm.  We exploit sneaky-save and sneaky-load to make it possible to
; debug loops without complicating the logical story of sexpr-fixpoint.
;
; Roughly, when SEXPR-DFS optimizes the list of s-expressions and tries to
; topologically sort them, it saves the loops it has found in
;
;    :SEXPR-LOOP-DEBUG-LOOPS
;
; But practically speaking these loops are hard to read because they are just
; lists of numbers.  That is, SEXPR-DFS works on "translated" sexprs, where the
; variables have been replaced by numbers so that we can use faster variable
; gathering routines.  So the loops are in terms of numbers that have nothing
; to do with the input variables.
;
; To make sense of these loops, we also save the INV-VARMAP (an alist mapping
; the numbers back to the original signal names) in
;
;    :SEXPR-LOOP-DEBUG-INV-VARMAP
;
; This varmap lets us translate the loops we have found back in terms of the
; original sexpr vars.

; Figuring out the Verilog signals that give rise to a loop.
;
; The following code basically assumes that the sexpr vars we're trying to
; reach a fixpoint for are VL emodwires.  This is probably a reasonable
; assumption if we're using ESIM to simulate modules produced by VL.
;
; What are we trying to do here?  Well, if ESIM is getting bogged down in
; apparent combinational loops, probably you need to install a custom function
; into ESIM-SIMPLIFY-UPDATE-FNS that will shannon-expand the clocks signals
; that are controlling certain latches so that the loop will go away.  The
; biggest problem is figuring out why there seems to be a loop and what we need
; to expand to break it.
;
; The loops that we're going to find in the course of our topological sort are
; all going to be in terms of ESIM wires, but they can have just gobs of signals
; because typically you have a loop like:
;
;    main inputs         +---- feedback
;             |          |   |
;          \---------------/ |
;           \     mux     /  |
;            \-----------/   |
;                  |         |
;              +-------+     |
;    clk --+---| LATCH |     |
;          |   +-------+     |
;          |       |         |
;          |    Do Stuff     |
;          |       |         |
;          |   +-------+     |
;          +--o| LATCH |     |
;              +-------+     |
;                  |         |
;                Result ------
;                  |
;
; And if the busses involved are wide then you can end up with basically all of
; the bits of each wire involved taking part in the loop.  This is too much
; stuff to look at.
;
; So what I want to do is basically collapse the loops down and just talk about
; Verilog wires instead of bits.  Beyond that, I want to make the output to be
; easy to plug into the module browser's wireview tool so you can just go and
; visualize the loop without having to do anything but copy and paste it into
; wireview.

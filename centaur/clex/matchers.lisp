  :long "<p>Matching functions are the main way of processing a string input
stream @(see sin).  Each matching function can recognize and extract some
particular kind of input from the start of the input stream.  We say that some
matchers are strong and some are weak:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Strong Matcher</dt>
<dd>On success, always matches at least some text.</dd>
<dd>Signature: @('(match-foo ... sin)') &rarr; @('(mv match sin)')</dd>
<dd>Examples: @(see sin-match-lit), @(see sin-match-charset*), ...</dd>

<dt>Weak Matcher</dt>
<dd>May succeed even without matching any text.</dd>
<dd>Signature: @('(match-foo ... sin)') &rarr; @('(mv okp match sin)')</dd>
<dd>Example: @(see sin-match-until-lit)</dd>
</dl>

<p>In either case, the @('match') returned is either</p>

<ul>
<li>@('nil'), to indicate that no text is matched, or</li>
<li>a non-empty string with text extracted from the start of the stream,</li>
</ul>

<p>and the resulting @('sin') is the updated input stream: when no text was
matched, @('sin') is unchanged; otherwise it is advanced just past whatever
text was matched.</p>

<p>Matching functions generally satisfy several basic properties that are
described in @(see def-match-thms).</p>")


(defsection def-match-thms
  :parents (matching-functions)
  :short "Prove basic properties about a matching function."

  :long "<p>The macro @('def-match-thms') can be used to prove some basic
theorems about a new matching function.</p>

<p>Note: typically, you should only want to use this macro if you are defining
a new matching function.  If you are just using existing matching functions
like @(see sin-match-lit) to write your own lexer, this isn't what you
want.</p>

<p>Form: @(call def-match-thms)</p>

<p>This expands into a @(see make-event).  The @('name') you give should be the
name of some newly defined matching function.  We look up the signature of
@('name') from the world and try to prove the matching function satisfies the
following properties.</p>

<p><b>Well-Typed.</b> The match is either a non-empty string or nil.  Note that
there is generally no reason to prove anything about the well-formedness of
@('sin'), itself.</p>

<p><b>Progress.</b> The length of the input stream's contents never increases,
and always decreases when text is matched.</p>

<p><b>Reconstruction.</b> Appending the matched text onto the new input
stream's contents yields the original input stream's contents.  In other words,
the matcher properly matches text from the front of the stream.</p>

<p><b>Graceful Failure.</b> If there is no match, the stream is
unchanged.</p>

<p><b>Match-Free Failure.</b> (weak matchers only) If the weak matcher
fails (i.e., it signals that @('okp') is @('nil')), then the @('match') it
returns is also @('nil').</p>"

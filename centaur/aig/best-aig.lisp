  :short "Algorithms for choosing \"better\" (smaller) AIGs."

  :long "<p>Given two AIGs, A and B, we say that A is \"better\" than B if:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A has fewer unique AND nodes than B, or</li>
 <li>A,B have the same number of unique AND nodes, but A has fewer
       total nodes than B.</li>
</ul>

<p>We provide two main functions for choosing good AIGs:</p>

<ul>

<li>@(see aig-list-best) chooses the best AIG from a non-empty list of
AIGs.</li>

<li>@(see aig-list-list-best) is given a list of non-empty AIG Lists, say
@('(L1 L2 ... Ln)'), and returns @('(B1 B2 ... Bn)'), where each @('Bi') is the
best AIG from the corresponding @('Li').</li>

</ul>

<p>You could just implement @(see aig-list-list-best) as an ordinary \"map\" or
projection of @(see aig-list-best).  But @('aig-list-list-best') is written in
a slightly smarter way than this, so that it can share the labels and
memoization results across all of the AIGs in all of the lists.</p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>It is tricky to directly count \"unique nodes\" in a memoized way, but there
is a very easy way to do it indirectly.</p>

<p>First, we assign a number to every unique AIG node in sight, which (assuming
constant-time hashing) is linear in the sizes of the input AIGs.  We call these
numbers labels.</p>

<p>Next, we can write memoized functions to gather the sets of labels for all
of the AND nodes within an AIG, and similarly for all of the nodes.  We just
use regular ordered sets to represent these sets.  Importantly, these
collection functions can be easily memoized.</p>

<p>Finally, to count the number of ANDs (or all nodes) in an AIG, we just
collect the labels for its ANDs (or all nodes) and see how many labels were
found.</p>

<p>BOZO it would probably be much better to use @(see sbitsets) to represent
label sets.  If we ever need to speed this up, that's probably the first thing
to try.</p>")

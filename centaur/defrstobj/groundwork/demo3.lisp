; GROUNDWORK DEMO 3
;
; This is like demo2.lisp, but I make FOO an array of integers instead of a
; single integer.  To the outside, the FOO field looks like a record that can
; hold any keys and values.  The restrictions on its size and values are
; relegated to guards and play no logical role.

; This is somewhat tricky.  My basic idea is to represent the FOO field with
; both an array and a record.  The array holds the indicies, 0 through 31 in
; this case.  The record holds any other keys that aren't valid indices in the
; real array.

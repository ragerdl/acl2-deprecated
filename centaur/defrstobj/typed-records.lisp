; typed-records.lisp
;
; This file is similar in spirit to coi/records/defrecord.lisp, which was
; described in the following paper.
;
;   David Greve and Matthew Wilding.  Typed ACL2 Records. ACL2 Workshop 2003.
;
; Loosely speaking, our goal here is to develop a record-like structure where
; the values always have a particular type.  The resulting structure satisfies
; almost the same theorems as in the misc/records book, but the g-same-s
; theorem becomes
;
;   (g a (s a v r)) = (foo-fix v)      ; instead of just being v
;
; And we gain the theorem (foop (g a r)).
;
; Greve and Wilding accomplish this by starting with an ordinary record, but
; instead of just storing values or fixed values into its slots, they instead
; store ENTRIES of the form (FOO . NON-ENTRY), where the FOO must be a foop
; that is not the default foop.  I started with this, but when I tried to
; extend it to be able to view a STOBJ array as a typed record, I ran into
; trouble.  I didn't see a good way to prove something akin to EQUAL-BY-G, and
; without that it didn't seem easy to adapt the basic approach I'd developed
; for untyped records to typed records.
;
; I went to Sol's office to gripe about this, and we started to try to more
; precisely understand what was problematic.  In a short time, we had come up
; with a different way to implement typed records that seems to be much more
; suitable.  In short, instead of using a misc/record with some kind of special
; entries, we directly develop a new kind of typed record where the well-formed
; records are only allowed to have values of the proper type.  This lets us
; nicely separate the bad part of the record (if any) from the good part, and
; obtain a theorem in the spirit of EQUAL-BY-G.
;
; This book develops a generic theory for typed records.  By itself this
; generic theory is not very useful, so you will want to also be aware of:
;
;  - def-typed-record.lisp
;       Provides the DEF-TYPED-RECORD macro for automatically instantiating
;       the typed records theory for a new, specific kind of type, and
;
;  - typed-record-tests.lisp
;       Several examples of using DEF-TYPED-RECORDS to introduce different
;       kinds of typed records.

;
; The theorem we now prove is something that Jared, Sol, and Anna came up with
; after experimenting with a toy machine model.  The problem we ran into was
; that we sometimes encountered goals of the form:
;
;   (implies ...
;            (equal (s :key1 val1 (s :key2 val2 (s :key3 val3 st)))
;                   (s :key1 val1' (s :key2 val2' (s :key3 val3' st)))))
;
; Where usually we had, e.g., VAL1 = VAL1', but there was *some* mistake that
; meant some particular VALi was not equal to VALi'.  Because of this mistake,
; the EQUAL could obviously not be resolved by ordinary (EQUAL X X) reduction.
;
; The problem is that these terms can be large, making it hard to figure out
; which VALi and VALi' are not equal.
;
; The idea of this theorem is that if we want to prove an equality like this,
; we will reduce it to proving that for some arbitrary key ARB,
;
;    (= (g ARB (s :key1 val1 .......))
;       (g ARB (s :key1 val1' .......)))
;
; As long as the strong form of the G-over-S rule is enabled, then the G can
; march through each side of the equality and split the goal into cases.  The
; first case is that G is :key1 and we need to show VAL1==VAL1'.  If that's
; easy we proceed to the next case and so on.  This process should result in
; reducing the goal down to just (= VALi VALi') for the values that don't
; obviously have this property.
;
; The rule has some tricky syntaxp hypotheses to prevent it from firing unless
; we're really trying to show an equality between s-nests.  For instance, if we
; have a hyp that is (equal (s :key1 val1 ...) (s :key1 val1' ...)), then we'll
; want to do something that doesn't reduce the equality to an arbitrary key.

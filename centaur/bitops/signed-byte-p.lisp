;
; Let V be the -B.  Then obviously AB = -AV and we are trying to show:

; Multiplying each side by negative 1 flips the inequality, so our goal is:

; A*B is also a signed 2N-bit number when A is signed N-bit and B is an
; unsigned N-bit number.  So, let's prove that now.  WLOG assume A is signed

;
;   0 <= a < 2^n-1
;   0 <= b < 2^n
;
; So ab <= 2^{n+n-1}

; Here's an example of what the above accomplishes:
;
; We can wrap up the standard output stream in multiple bridge-ostreams.  We
; can then print to these streams using ordinary functions like write-string,
; write-char, format, etc., and it automatically wraps everything up into
; messages and does the necessary multiplexing.
;
; Note for multithreading: we don't currently do anything to lock writes.  If
; you have multiple Lisp threads printing to the same bridge-ostream, it's
; going to cause probelms.

; Worker Output Setup.
;
; The goal here is to get printing to FMT, CW, etc., routed through the
; client's output stream.
;
; Binding *STANDARD-OUTPUT* is easy.
;
; Binding *STANDARD-CO* is slightly trickier.  The value of *STANDARD-CO* is
; just a symbol, e.g., ACL2-OUTPUT-CHANNEL::STANDARD-CHARACTER-OUTPUT-0, and
; functions like PRINC$ use GET-OUTPUT-STREAM-FROM-CHANNEL to look up the
; associated stream.  So, to fit into this scheme, we need to bind
; *STANDARD-CO* to a new symbol that is associated with our particular stream.
;
; Unfortunately, aside from *standard-co*, there are also several state globals
; that ACL2 uses to do printing.  These include standard-co (again), proofs-co
; and trace-co.
;
; The way these work is really complicated.  Basically if you do (global-symbol
; 'proofs-co), you'll get a symbol like ACL2_GLOBAL_ACL2::PROOFS-CO.  Even
; though this symbol doesn't have *s around its name, it's a special, and
; whatever value it's bound to is the name of the actual channel (not stream)
; to use.  After some poking around I found you can use PROGV to bind these.
; What a mess!

; Access to the Main Thread ---------------------------------------------------

;
; This is a huge hack.  It lets us use the main thread as the authoritative
; hons space.  And it lets us get around the fact that the memoize code is just
; not at all thread safe, and you can't even try to run a memoized computation
; from another thread.

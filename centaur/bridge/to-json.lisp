  :short "Simple encoder to convert ACL2 Objects into JSON Objects."

  :long "<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Sensibly converting ACL2 objects into JSON is not at all
straightforward.</p>

<p>On one hand, JSON is very rich.  Should we try to map association lists into
JSON objects, or should we just treat all cons trees the same and use arrays?
Since JSON has distinct NULL and FALSE values, which should we map NIL
into?</p>

<p>On the other, JSON is missing some types that we would like.  Should we just
map ACL2 symbols and strings into strings, and lose the distinction between
them?  What on earth should we do with rationals and complex numbers?  Should
we assume that the JSON consumer supports bignums, or use a separate bignum
encoding?</p>

<p>Arguably, the \"safe\" approach would be: develop a reliable JSON encoding
that ensures a unique interpretation of each ACL2 object.  For instance, we
should keep symbols and strings separate, record the name/package of each
symbol separately, etc.</p>

<p>But that would suck.  The resulting JSON objects would be full of unwieldy
type information, which most of the time we wouldn't care about.  Usually, we
are hooking up ACL2 to web pages or other interfaces that want to get some
simple, small fragments of data.  In this context, I'd prefer a simple
representation that is easy to work with, even at the cost of losing some
precision.</p>

<h3>Atoms</h3>

<p>I encode every ACL2 atom as a JSON string.  For example:</p>

@({
      Lisp Atom           JSON
    ---------------------------------------
       NIL                \"NIL\"
       T                  \"T\"
       FOO                \"FOO\"
       :FOO               \":FOO\"
       \"foo\"              \"foo\"
       #\\f                \"f\"
       123                \"123\"
       -123               \"-123\"
       -1/2               \"-1/2\"
       #c(17/2 -3/8)      \"#C(17/2 -3/8)\"
    ---------------------------------------
})

<p>This has many quirks.  The main weirdness is that there are many ACL2
objects which, although they are not EQUAL, cannot be told apart from one
another in the JSON world.  For instance, the atoms on each line below have
identical JSON encodings:</p>

<ul>
<li>@('ACL2::FOO,    VL::FOO,     \"FOO\"          ')</li>
<li>@('ACL2::F,      VL::F,       \"F\",      #\\F ')</li>
<li>@('ACL2::|123|,  VL::|123|,   \"123\",    123  ')</li>
<li>@(':FOO,         \":FOO\",    ACL2::|:FOO|     ')</li>
</ul>

<p>Some motivation behind this approach:</p>

<ul>

<li>Why use \"NIL\" and \"T\" instead of, e.g., JSON's null (or false) and
true?  The main reason is that null/true can't be used as keys in JSON objects,
so this would lead to either special handling of alists with nil/t keys, or
alists that have different encoding depending on their keys, and it just seems
simpler to use strings for all atoms.</li>

<li>Why use \"123\" when JSON has integers?  The same reason as for NIL and T
applies, but also: the JSON \"spec\" doesn't mandate what ranges of numbers its
implementations have to support, and practically speaking many of its
implementations don't use bignums.  So, what are the options?  (1) Use integers
for small numbers and do something special for bignums.  But this would be
quite error prone when programming the client.  (2) Assume bignums are
supported and just accept that clients will see garbage in some cases.  But
that is just terrible.  So given all this, just using strings seems like the
best thing to do.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Conses</h3>

<p>With one exception (see below), I encode any true-lists as a JSON arrays
containing its encoded elements, and I encode any \"improper\" list as a JSON
array containing its encoded elements AND its final cdr.  For example:</p>

@({
       Lisp Object                     JSON
    -------------------------------------------------------------
       (a . nil)                       [\"A\"]
       (a . b)                         [\"A\",\"B\"]
       (a b . nil)                     [\"A\",\"B\"]
       (a b . c)                       [\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"]
       (a b c . nil)                   [\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"]
       ((a . b) (c . d) . e)           [[\"A\",\"B\"],[\"C\",\"D\"],\"E\"]
})

<p>This has its own quirks.  For instance, as with atoms, you can't tell the
difference between Lisp objects like: (A B C) and (A B . C).</p>

<p>The exception is that, for proper ALISTS whose every key is an atom, I
instead generate the corresponding JSON Object.  For example:</p>

@({
       Lisp Object                     JSON
    -------------------------------------------------------------
       ((a . b))                      {\"A\":\"B\"}
       ((a . b) (c . d))              {\"A\":\"B\",\"C\":\"D\"}
       ((a . b) (c . d) . e)          [[\"A\",\"B\"],[\"C\",\"D\"],\"E\"]
})

<p>In certain cases, this runs the risk that you might see a different encoding
for an alist, depending on whether or not you have inserted a cons.  But many
alists have atoms as keys, and it seems nice to use a real JSON object here
instead of a nested array of arrays.</p>


<h3>Note about Top-Level JSON Objects</h3>

<p>Top-level @('JSON-text') objects must, according to the JSON grammer, be
either JSON Objects or Arrays.  Note that <b>WE DO NOT OBEY THIS.</b> If the
object we're given is an ordinary ACL2 atom, we just encode it as a JSON
string.</p>

<p>We found this to be useful in our client code.  It's nice to create a JSON
object that says: the return value is such and so, the standard output was such
and so, and the error value was such and so.  In this context, we just want to
stitch our ACL2 object into a larger piece of JSON text, and strings are
okay.</p>")

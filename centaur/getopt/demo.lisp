  :long "<p>This is a basic demo of how to use getopt, and a collection of unit
tests to make sure getopt is working correctly.</p>

<p>Note: our focus in this demo is just on the command-line parsing piece.  We
illustrate illustrates a lot of the things you can do with getopt, e.g., short
aliases, long names, default values, validating inputs, and accumulating
arguments.  But we <b>don't</b> turn it into a working program.  If you want to
understand how @(see getopt) and @(see argv) and @(see save-exec) fit together,
see @(see demo2).</p>

<p>This @('defoptions') call does two things:</p>

<ul>

<li>It introduces @('demo-p'), an ordinary @(see std::defaggregate) with
various fields and well-formedness conditions.  These @('demo-p') structures
can be passed around throughout your program just like any ordinary ACL2
object.</li>

<li>It introduces @(see parse-demo), a function that can parse a command-line
into a @('demo-p').  The command-line is represented as a list of strings; see
for instance @(see oslib::argv) to understand how to get the command-line
arguments given to ACL2.</li>

</ul>"

  ;; GETOPT::DEFOPTIONS is a strict superset of defaggregate.  So, everything
  ;; here should look very familiar if you have created aggregates:

  :tag :demo

  ((help    "Print a help message and exit with status 0."
            booleanp
            :rule-classes :type-prescription

            ;; Because this field is a Boolean, defoptions automatically
            ;; "knows" to treat it as a plain option, i.e., it knows that
            ;; --help takes no extra argument.

            ;; You don't have to tell it to use --help, either, because it
            ;; just figures that out from the field name.

            ;; However, if we want to also support -h, we need to tell it
            ;; to treat the letter #\h as an alias for help:
            :alias #\h)

   (verbose "Turn on excessive debugging information."
            booleanp
            :rule-classes :type-prescription

            ;; As with --help, there's little "extra" work to do here.  We
            ;; won't create an alias, because we'll use -v for --version.

             ;; don't need to put in a :parser option here because parse-nat is
             ;; the default for natp fields, but just to make this demo more
             ;; complete I include it.

            ;; This option is more interesting in several ways.  The idea here
            ;; is that the user can say, e.g.,
            ;;
            ;;   --dir /usr --dir /home --dir /bin
            ;;
            ;; And these options should all get bundled up together into a
            ;; single list.

            ;; Well, internally in our program, we want to think of this as a
            ;; list of dirs.  So, we want to call the field "dirs".  But the
            ;; user enters one dir at a time, so we want the user-visible
            ;; option name to be different.  We can do that by overriding the
            ;; longname that defoptions generates by default:
            :longname "dir"

            ;; Now, defoptions has no default way to parse in a string-listp.
            ;; But it does have a built-in string parser, which we can reuse.
            ;; So, first, tell it to use the string parser:
            :parser getopt::parse-string

            ;; But that wouldn't be enough on its own, because if we just set
            ;; it to use parse-string, then that produces a stringp instead of
            ;; a string-listp, and our proofs would fail.  Instead, we need to
            ;; tell defoptions how to merge the results of the parser with the
            ;; previous value.  Using CONS would actually reverse the order of
            ;; the dirs, because the options are processed in order.  So we
            ;; avoid that by using rcons, to push the strings on the end.
            :merge rcons)

  :long "<p>This is a quick check to try to ensure that ACL2 can communicate
with your SAT solver correctly.  If it notices any problems, it will just cause
a @(see hard-error).  A basic way to use it would be, e.g.,:</p>

@({
    (include-book \"centaur/satlink/check-config\" :dir :system)
    (defconst *my-config* (satlink::make-config ...))
    (value-triple (satlink::check-config *my-config*))
})

<p>It's a good idea to run this check when you install a new SAT solver, to
ensure that your paths, command-line options, etc., are being handled
correctly.  It should catch basic problems such as:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Your solver isn't in your PATH</li>
 <li>Your solver is crashing because it wants some other @('libc')</li>
 <li>Your solver doesn't like some option you're passing to it</li>
 <li>Your solver doesn't understand what file to process</li>
 <li>Your solver isn't printing counterexamples</li>
 <li>Your solver isn't producing DIMACS formatted output</li>
</ul>

<p>This is <b>not</b> any kind of comprehensive stress test of the SAT solver
itself.  We just run @(see sat) on a few small formulas to see if your solver
is producing the expected results.</p>"

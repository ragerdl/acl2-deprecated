(in-package "ACL2")

; Preload all Quicklisp libraries that we're making available.  The goal here
; is to defeat build parallelism and ensure that the packages are loaded in a
; serial manner.  Otherwise, e.g., we can have two Quicklisp packages that are
; both being built at separate times in separate threads, crashing into each
; other's working space.

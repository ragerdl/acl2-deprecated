(defun hl-sizeof (thing)

; Highly CCL-specific.  This function computes something like "the size of
; thing in bytes," and was originally developed by Gary Byers in response to a
; question on the CCL mailing list.  Jared only changed the names so it can be
; in the ACL2 package and added this comment.
;
; Note: determining memory usage is subtle and this function does NOT
; necessarily give you the whole story.  For instance, in CCL each hash table
; has a uvector inside of it that holds the data elements.  So, the (hl-sizeof
; ht) for some hash table doesn't actually descend into this field!
;
; The following comment was left by Gary:

  ;; All memory-allocated objects in CCL are either CONSes or
  ;; "UVECTOR"s; a UVECTOR contains a header which describes the
  ;; object's primitive type (represented as an (UNSIGNED-BYTE 8) and
  ;; accessible via the function CCL::TYPECODE) and element-count
  ;; (accessible via the function CCL::UVSIZE.)  A function defined in
  ;; the compiler backend knows how to map from a typecode and
  ;; element-count to a size in octets.  UVECTORs are aligned on
  ;; doubleword boundaries and contain this extra header word, so the
  ;; "physical size" of the uvector is a bit bigger.  On x86-64,
  ;; SYMBOLs and FUNCTIONs have their own tag, but there's an
  ;; underlying UVECTOR.

(in-package "SET")

;; This book uses the "witness-cp" book to set up a clause processor for set
;; reasoning based on the osets library.  We use a similar strategy to the one
;; used in equiv-sets.lisp for reasoning about ordinary member-equal on lists.

;; Basically, this book provides a hint that can aid in reasoning about set
;; equivalence, subset, intersection, or emptiness.  It reduces all of these
;; concepts to reasoning about IN, that is, set membership.  So if you define
;; new set constructors, you need only prove a theorem like
;;   (equal (in a (my-set-constructor x y z)) ...)
;; in order for this book to reason smoothly about it.

;; You may use this hint manually like this:
;; (defthm foo
;;    ...
;;   :hints ((set::osets-reasoning)))

;; or you may (locally) set up a default hint and a suitable theory for the
;; hint by doing:
;;  (set::use-osets-reasoning)

;; What does this strategy do?  We think of the set predicates subset,
;; intersectp, empty, and equal as involving quantifiers.  For example,
;; (subset x y) really means (forall a (implies (in a x) (in a y))).

;; We do two things with this quantifier-based interpretation of each
;; predicate, based on whether it occurs positively or negatively.  This
;; determination is based on two factors -- whether its implicit quantifier is
;; universal or existential, and whether it occurs as a negated or non-negated
;; literal in the goal clause.  Arbitrarily, let's call it a positive
;; occurrence if it is a universal quantifier that occurs negated in the
;; clause, that is, non-negated in a hypothesis.  E.g., we have a
;; (subset a b) hypothesis.  Conversely, it's a negative occurrence if a
;; universal quantifier occurs as a non-negated conclusion or negated
;; hypothesis, or if an existential quantifier occurs as a negated hypothesis
;; or non-negated conclusion.

;; First we look at negative occurrences -- think of a (not (subset x y))
;; hypothesis.  What this really says is there exists some object A for which
;; (not (implies (in a x) (in a y))).  So we replace this hypothesis with this
;; assumption, where a is a fresh variable.  We do the following such
;; replacements, where A is a fresh variable in each case --

;;    Hypothesis                 Replacement 
;;  (not (subset x y))       (and (in a x) (not (in a y)))
;;  (intersectp x y)         (and (in a x) (in a y))
;;  (not (equal x y))        (implies (and (setp x) (setp y))
;;                                    (xor (in a x) (in a y)))
;;  (not (empty x))          (not (in a x)).

;; For a positive occurrence -- think of a (subset a b) hypothesis -- we may
;; instantiate the implicit quantified formula one or more times, depending
;; what we find in the term.  For (subset x y), we may insert one or more terms
;; (implies (in a x) (in a y)) for elements a.  How do we determine which A's
;; to instantiate these terms with?  We look for various patterns that indicate
;; that some term represents a possible set element of interest:

;;    Pattern                   Possible interesting element
;; (in a x)                     a
;; (insert a x)                 a
;; (delete a x)                 a
;; (head x)                     (head x)

;; Note that since we replace negative occurrences with their instantiations
;; before we collect these interesting terms, among these collected terms are
;; any fresh variables introduced by those replacements.

;; We collect all such possibly-interesting terms and instantiate each positive
;; occurrence with all of them.  That is, we replace the following hypotheses
;; with a conjunction of replacements, with A set using the various patterns
;; above:

;;   Hypothesis                  Replacement
;; (subset x y)               (implies (in a x) (in a y))
;; (not (intersectp x y))     (not (and (in a x) (in a y)))
;; (equal x y)                (iff (in a x) (in a y))
;; (empty x)                  (not (in a x))

;; After we do these replacements, we're done.  What does this get us?
;; Basically, we've reduced all our implicit quantifiers to a bunch of IN
;; queries.  Because we have nice reductive rules about applying IN to the
;; various set constructors (such as insert, delete, union, intersection,
;; and difference), much of this boils away to just a bunch of Boolean logic
;; about IN applied to various variables.

;; For example, take the following theorem
;; (thm (implies (and (subset x y)
;;                    (not (subset x (union z w))))
;;               (not (subset (intersect (union x (union z w)) y)
;;                            (intersect (union z w) y)))))

;; If submit this form after loading this book and doing
;; (set::use-osets-reasoning),  ACL2 does the following:

;; First, negative occurrences.
;; The only negative occurrence is (not (subset x (union z w))).  This is
;; therefore replaced by:

;; (and (in nsubw0 x) (not (in nsubw0 (union z w))))

;; (Here nsubw0 happens to be the fresh variable chosen for the instantiation.)

;; We then look for interesting terms.  The only ones we find are the ones
;; produced by our previous replacement, (in nsubw0 x) and (in nsubw0 (union z
;; w)) -- in both cases the possible interesting element is nsubw0.  So we
;; instantiate our two positive occurrences,
;; (subset x y)
;; and
;; (subset (intersect (union x (union z w)) y)
;;         (intersect (union z w) y))
;; with their application to nsubw0.  This results in the following goal:
;;
;; (implies (and (implies (in nsubw0 x) (in nsubw0 y))
;;               (and (in nsubw0 x) (not (in nsubw0 (union z w)))))
;;          (not (implies (in nsubw0 (intersect (union x (union z w)) y))
;;                        (in nsubw0 (intersect (union z w) y))))).
;;
;; Applying rewrite rules UNION-IN and INTERSECT-IN, this becomes:
;; (implies (and (implies (in nsubw0 x) (in nsubw0 y))
;;               (and (in nsubw0 x) (not (or (in nsubw0 z) (in nsubw0 w)))))
;;          (not (implies (and (or (in nsubw0 x) (in nsubw0 z) (in nsubw0 w))
;;                             (in nsubw0 y))
;;                        (and (or (in nsubw0 z) (in nsubw0 w))
;;                             (in nsubw0 y)))))
;; Notice that all we're left with is Boolean connectives and IN applied to
;; various variables.  At this point we might as well be proving:
;; (implies (and (implies x y)
;;               (and x (not (or z w))))
;;          (not (implies (and (or x z w) y)
;;                        (and (or z w) y))))
;; which is a simple enough tautology for ACL2's built-in Boolean reasoning to
;; prove.

                     General Instructions and Disclaimers

  * We generally use 64-bit CCL on Linux or Darwin as the host lisp, and build
    ACL2 with the Hons extension enabled.  It wouldn't be too surprising if
    some books either don't certify or don't function well in other setups.  A
    good way to build ACL2 might be:

       make LISP=ccl ACL2_HONS=h ACL2_SIZE=3000000

  * We generally expect there to be ample memory available.  Of course, many
    books are quite ordinary ACL2 stuff like arithmetic lemmas, and these don't
    need any special resources.  But you certainly won't be able to do any kind
    of serious BDD computations without, say, at least 8 GB of memory.

  * We use "cert.pl bookname" instead of Makefiles.  You'll need a working Perl
    installation, and cert.pl will need to be in your PATH.  The cert.pl script
    is in the acl2/books directory, i.e., :dir :system.  If you're unfamiliar
    with it, see "cert.pl --help."

  * We expect these books to be much less stable than ordinary ACL2 books,
    since we are actively using them and often need to extend them.

  * BOZO probably add some way to build the documentation, and some kind of
    getting started/overview documentation...

  * If you have questions or comments about these books, please email Jared
    Davis and Sol Swords, {jared,sswords}@centtech.com.  We can't really offer
    any serious technical support, but may be able to answer some questions in
    a "low bandwidth" way.

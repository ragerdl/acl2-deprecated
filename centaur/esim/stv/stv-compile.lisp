the STV is syntactically well-formed, only refers to legitimate inputs and
outputs, and so forth.  After sanity checking, our basic goal is to compile the
STV into a form that functions like @(see stv-run) and @(see stv-debug) can
efficiently process.</p>

<p>In particular, after (successfully) compiling an STV we obtain a @(see
compiled-stv-p) structure that says says how many steps we need to run for,
explains the mappings from user-level simulation variables to their internal
bit-encodings, and and has pre-computed alists for restricting the a @(see
esim) run and extracting the results.</p>

<p>Compilation is a syntactic process that is relatively cheap.  We @(see
memoize) it mainly in the hopes of keeping the various alists we create the
same across multiple evaluations of an STV.</p>

<p>Note that to reuse the same @(see esim) simulations across related STVs, our
basic approach in @(see stv-run) is to do a fully general simulation of the
module for N cycles.  In this general simulation, we set @('|foo[0]|') to
@('|foo[0].P3|') during phase 3, and so forth.  The idea is that instead of
re-running @(see esim) for each STV, we will just specialize this alist by
using @(see 4v-sexpr-restrict) to replace @('|foo[0].P3|') with whatever value
we want for @('|foo[0]|') at phase 3.</p>

<p>The function @(see stv-restrict-alist) pre-computes these bindings.
Essentially it just needs to build a big alist that binds the suffixed input
names to the sexprs that we generated in @(see stv-expand-input-lines),
above.</p>

<p>The outputs are somewhat similar.  The function @(see stv-extraction-alists)
builds a list of alists that say, for each step, which output bits we want to
collect and how we want to name them.</p>"

simulations.  We could have just had @(see stv-fully-general-simulation-run)
always compute them, but computing the internal signals can be expensive so we
want to avoid it unless we're actually doing debugging.</p>

<p>Due to the structure of esim, we get a lot of memoized sharing between the
@('-run') and @('-debug') functions.  This works out very nicely, so that it's
not much more expensive to do a @('-debug') after first doing a @('-run') than
it is to just do a @('-debug') from the beginning.</p>

<p>We memoize this function so that if we're reusing an STV, we can just reuse
the same general simulation repeatedly as we debug with different values.  BOZO
as with the -run function, maybe we should be doing the memoization at the level
of individual steps, instead of memoizing the whole thing.</p>"

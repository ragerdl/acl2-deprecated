<p>This function evaluates an STV under the input alist, like @(see stv-run).
However, @(see stv-run) effectively binds to X all input and initial state
variables not set by the input alist (the don't-cares).  Thus, for each output,
@(see stv-run) produces either</p>

<ul>
<li>an integer giving the value of that output, signifying that the don't-cares
do not effect that output</li>
<li>an X, signifying that for some bit of that output, either the don't-cares
may effect the value, or the value is X independent of the don't-cares.</li>
</ul>

<p>This function instead produces:</p>
<ul>
<li>an integer giving the value of that output, signifying that the don't-cares
do not effect that output <em>as long as they are Boolean-valued</em></li>
<li>an X, signifying that for some bit of that output, either the don't-cares
may effect the value <em>even when they are restricted to Boolean values</em>,
or the value is X independent of the don't-cares.</li>
</ul>

<p>This function cannot always be straightforwardly computed: it may sometimes
require solving a SAT problem to show that all possible assignments of Boolean
values to the don't-care bits produce the same value of the outputs.  Rather
than calling a SAT solver in the midst of computing this function, we instead
compute the result when it is straightforward, and produce an error (by calling
a non-executable function) when it isn't.</p>

<p>Even when this function does not execute, it may be possible to prove that
its result (say) matches a spec function, by doing the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prove that the desired property holds of @(see stv-run-squash-dontcares)</li>
<li>Prove that @(see stv-run-check-dontcares) holds of the inputs to this
function, for all don't-care alists.</li>
</ul>

  :short "@('Defwellformed') is a macro for introducing well-formedness
checking functions."

  :long "<h3>Motivation</h3>

<p>Throughout VL, there are many functions that check to see whether some
module element is well-formed.  When we introduce these well-formedness checks,
we often want to have two versions of the check:</p>

<ol>

<li>A <b>vanilla</b> Boolean-valued predicate, @('foo-okp'), that causes no
side effects and is easy to reason about, and</li>

<li>A <b>debugging</b> function, @('foo-okp-warn') that generates useful @(see
warnings) that explain precisely why the object is malformed.  In particular,
@('foo-okp-warn') takes a warnings accumulator as an extra argument, and
returns @('(mv okp warnings')').</li>

</ol>

<p>The value of the debugging function is probably obvious: it allows us to
provide a better explanation for why some module is not being translated.  But
the debugging function is <i>not</i> well-suited for reasoning.  In particular,
in theorems we generally do not care about which warnings have been
accumulated; we only want to know whether some structure is well-formed.  If we
try to use the debugging function directly for this purpose, we might write
theorems such as:</p>

@({
 (implies (and (foo-p x)
               (car (foo-okp-warn x warnings)))
          (consequence x))
})

<p>The problem with such a theorem is that @('warnings') is a free variable,
which can cause problems for ACL2 when it tries to apply the rule.</p>

<p>So, our approach is to introduce <b>both</b> versions of the well-formedness
check, and then add a theorem that shows the first value returned by
@('foo-okp-warn') is exactly the value returned by @('foo-okp').  Accordingly,
we can run @('foo-okp-warn') in our code and get useful warning messages, but
we can always reason about the simpler function @('foo-okp').</p>

<p>Unfortunately, writing two versions of a function comes at its own cost; we
have to duplicate the code, keep both versions in sync, and write these
boilerplate theorems.  The macro @(srclink defwellformed) allows us to automate
this process.</p>

<h3>Using @('defwellformed')</h3>

<p>The @('defwellformed') macro is similar to @('defun').  The general form
is:</p>

@({
 (defwellformed foo-okp (x other-args ...)
   :guard (and (foop x) ...)
   :body [...]
   :extra-decls ((xargs ...))
   :parents ...
   :short ...
   :long ...)
})

<p>Here, @('foo-okp') is the name of the new vanilla function, and @('(x
other-args ...)') are the formals.  The @(':guard') and @(':body') are used in
the @('defun') form we generate, as are any @(':extra-decls') that you need.
Finally, the @('parents'), @('short'), and @('long') fields are as in @(see
defxdoc).</p>

<p>The debugging function is always named by appending @('-warn') to the name
of the vanilla function.  Having such a convention is necessary for our
implementation of @('(@wf-call ...)').</p>

<h5>Meta-macros</h5>

<p>The tricky part to using defwellformed is to write a @(':body') that serves
both as the vanilla definition and as the debugging definition.  To accomplish
this, we make use of certain \"meta-macros\", which can be identifier with the
prefix @('@wf-').</p>

<p>In particular, the bodies of our well-formedness checks generally look
something like this:</p>

@({
 (let ((bar ...)
       (baz ...))
   (@wf-progn
    (@wf-assert condition1 [type msg args])
    (@wf-assert condition2 [type msg args])
    (@wf-note condition type msg args)
    (@wf-call other-wf-check ...)
    ...))
})

<p>These @('@wf-') expressions are only valid in the body of the
@('defwellformed') command, and are given <b>different expansions</b> depending
upon whether we are in the vanilla or debugging version of the function.</p>

<p>In the vanilla function,</p>
<ul>
  <li>@('(@wf-progn ...)') becomes @('(and ...)')</li>
  <li>@('(@wf-and ...)') becomes @('(and ...)')</li>
  <li>@('(@wf-assert condition ...)') becomes @('(if condition t nil)')</li>
  <li>@('(@wf-note condition ...)') becomes @('t')</li>
  <li>@('(@wf-call other-wf-check ...)') becomes @('(other-wf-check ...)')</li>
</ul>

<p>But in the debugging function, a more complex expansion is used.</p>

<dl>
<dt>(@wf-progn ...)</dt>

<dd>This becomes an appropriate @('mv-let') strucutre to handle the return
values from @('@wf-assert') and @('@') commands.  Note that in the debugging
version <b>execution continues</b> after a violation is discovered so that we
uncover as many problems as possible.  This behavior can cause problems for
guard verification: you cannot rely upon the earlier assertions having
\"passed\" in the guards of your later assertions.  Hence the introduction of
@('@wf-and').</dd>

<dt>(@wf-and ...)</dt>

<dd>This becomes an @('mv-let') structure as in @('@wf-progn'), but
<b>execution stops</b> when any assertion is violated.</dd>

<dt>(@wf-assert condition type msg args)</dt>

<dd>If the condition is violated, @('okp') becomes @('nil') and we add
a (non-fatal) warning of the indicated type, message, and arguments.</dd>

<dt>(@wf-note condition type msg args)</dt>

<dd>We add a warning of the indicated type, message, and args, to the list of
warnings, but we do not set @('okp') to @('nil').  That is, this is just a way
to note suspicious things that aren't necessarily outright problems.</dd>

<dt>(@wf-call other-wf-check ...)</dt>

<dd>Becomes @('(other-wf-check-warn ...)').  In other words, this allows you to
call the vanilla version of some subsidiary well-formedness check from the
vanilla version of your function, and the debugging version from your debugging
function.</dd>

</dl>

<p>Note also that @(srclink defwellformed-list) allows you to call a
well-formedness predicate on every element in a list, and that @(srclink
mutual-defwellformed) is a replacement for @('mutual-recursion') that allows
for the mutually-recursive use of @('defwellformed').</p>")

  :short "Handling of string literals."

  :long "<p>String literals are sequences of ASCII characters that are
enclosed in \"double quotes.\"</p>

<p>Verilog-2005 and SystemVerilog-2012 have some differences here, and Verilog
implementations like Verilog-XL, NCVerilog, and VCS generally don't seem to
follow the standard.  We discuss some of the nuances here.</p>


<h5>Line Continuations</h5>

<p>The Verilog-2005 standard says that strings are contained on a single line,
but SystemVerilog-2012 adds a line continuation sequence, @('\\<newline>'),
which doesn't become part of the string.  That is,</p>

@({
     $display(\"Hello \\
     World\");
})

<p>Is invalid in Verilog-2005, but prints @('\"Hello World\"') in
SystemVerilog-2012.  While Verilog-XL doesn't appear to implement this new
syntax, but NCVerilog and VCS both do.</p>

<p>What counts as a newline?  Let @('NL') denote the newline character and
@('CR') denote carriage return.  Both NCVerilog and VCS appear to accept only
exactly @('\\ NL'):</p>

<ul>

<li>They report syntax errors complaining about multi-line strings when given
string literals that include @('\\ CR NL'); presumably they are translating
@('\\ CR') into a plain @('CR') and then hitting the @('NL'), thinking it is
not escaped.</li>

<li>They accept @('\\ CR'), but leave a @('CR') character in the output, so it
seems they are treating this as just an escaped CR character instead of a line
continuation.</li>

<li>They accept @('\\ NL CR'), but leave a @('CR') character in the output.
So, it seems they just matching the @('\\ NL') part as the line continuation,
and then treating the CR as an ordinary character.</li>

</ul>

<p>We will allow or prohibit line continuations based on the @(see
vl-edition-p) being used.  When it is allowed, we will accept only exactly
@('\\ NL'), like VCS and NCVerilog.</p>


<h5>Basic Escapes</h5>

<p>Verilog-2005 (Section 3.6.3) <i>could</i> be interpreted as prohibiting raw
tab characters, but experimentation with tools like Verilog-XL, NCVerilog, and
VCS suggest that tab characters should be accepted in strings, so we allow
them.</p>

<p>Strings in both Verilog-2005 and SystemVerilog-2012 can make use of the
following, basic escape sequences:</p>

<table>
<tr> <td> @(' \\n ')   </td> <td> Newline           </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> @(' \\t ')   </td> <td> Tab               </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> @(' \\\\ ')  </td> <td> @('\\') character </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> @(' \\\" ')  </td> <td> @('\"') character </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>These sequences seem to work on Verilog-XL, NCVerilog, and VCS without any
issues.</p>


<h5>Octal Escapes</h5>

<p>Verilog-2005 also allows for the encoding of arbitrary ASCII characters
using an octal escape sequences.</p>


<table>
<tr> <td> @(' \\ddd ') </td>
     <td> Character by octal code of 1-3 digits @('(0 <= d <= 7)')</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Note that 377 in octal is 255 in decimal, so a sequence such as @('\\378')
is not really a valid character code.  The Verilog standard says that
implementations may issue an error in such cases.  In practice, none of
Verilog-XL, NCVerilog, or VCS complain about @('\\378').  Even so, it seems
reasonable for us to notice and fail with errors in this case.</p>

<p>The Verilog-2005 standard explains the handling of @('\\ddd') nicely.
Unfortunately, SystemVerilog-2012 has made quite a muddle of it.</p>

<p>In the SystemVerilog standard, they have replaced the informal description
of octal digits with the more precise @('octal_digit') production.  This leads
to a mess because @('octal_digit'), used in numbers, can include X and Z
digits.  To work around this stupid new problem they've just caused, the
standard goes on to restrict these octal_digits not to be x_digits or z_digits.
They further say that an @('x_digit') or @('z_digit') cannot follow a
@('\\ddd') sequence with fewer than 3 characters.</p>

<p>This means that certain sequences like @('\\40x') or @('\\40?'), which were
perfectly valid in Verilog 2005, are no longer valid in SystemVerilog 2012.</p>

<p>In practice, none of Verilog-XL, NCVerilog, or VCS implements this
restriction.  However, since these are probably a very rare and esoteric thing
to write in the first place, it seems reasonable for VL to prohibit these
sequences.</p>


<h5>Additional SystemVerilog-2012 Escapes</h5>

<p>The SystemVerilog-2012 standard introduces some new, simple escape
sequences:</p>

<table>
<tr> <td> @(' \\v ')   </td> <td> Vertical Tab      </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> @(' \\f ')   </td> <td> Form Feed         </td> </tr>
<tr> <td> @(' \\a ')   </td> <td> Bell              </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>None of these sequences seem to be implemented on Verilog-XL, NCVerilog, or
VCS.  Instead, when these tools encounter sequences like @('\\v'), they seem to
simply produce @('v'), and for @('\\x00'), they simply produce @('x00').</p>

<p>We nevertheless try to follow the standard, and properly implement these
escape sequences for suitable @(see vl-edition-p)s.</p>

<p>SystemVerilog 2012 also adds some ambiguous language (Section 5.9) that
<i>Nonprinting and other special characters are preceded with a backslash</i>.
It's not clear whether this is just an informal description of what the escape
tables mean, or if we're supposed to allow any non-printable character to be
included in a string literal by preceding it with a backslash.  To try to
ensure compatibility, VL rejects any characters other than those explicitly in
the table to be preceded by backslashes.</p>


<h5>Hex escapes</h5>

<p>SystemVerilog-2012 also adds a way to specify characters by hexadecimal
character codes:</p>

<table>
<tr> <td> @(' \\xdd ') </td> <td> Character by one or two hex digits</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>As with octal digits, the definition is muddled by the use of
@('hex_digit'), which leads to the possibility of x and z characters that then
have to be ruled out separately.</p>

<p>None of Verilog-XL, SystemVerilog, or VCS seems to implement hex escapes
yet.  Instead, sequences like @('\\x0') simply get displayed as @('x0'), as if
the @('\\x') is being converted into an @('x').  VL implements the
standard.</p>")

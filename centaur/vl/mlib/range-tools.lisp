  :long "<p>In Verilog, ranges are used in net and register declarations, and
also in module- and gate-instance declarations to describe arrays of modules
or gates.</p>

<p>For gate and module instances, the Verilog-2005 standard is pretty clear.
7.1.5 covers gate instances and 12.1.2 says that module instances have the same
rules.  In short, neither side has to be larger than the other, neither side
has to be zero, and it always specifies abs(left-right)+1 occurrences (so that
if they're the same it means one gate).</p>

<p>BOZO consider \"negative\" numbers and what they might mean.</p>

<p>The specification doesn't give similarly crisp semantics to net and reg
ranges.  Verilog-XL is horribly permissive, allowing even negative indexes and
such.  But Verilog-XL indeed seems to treat w[1:1] as a single bit, and in the
Centaur design there are occurrences of [0:0] and [1:1] and such.  So it may be
that the semantics are supposed to be the same?  It turns out that there are at
least some differences, e.g., you're not allowed to select bit 0 from a plain
wire, but you can select bit 0 from w[0:0], etc.</p>

<p>Historically, VL required the msb index is not smaller than the lsb index.
But we now try to permit designs that use ranges that go from both high to low
and low to high.</p>

<p>The difference is that for a wire like @('wire [5:0] w'), the most
significant bit is @('w[5]') and the least significant is @('w[0]'), whereas
for @('wire [0:5] v'), the most significant bit is @('v[0]') and the least
significant is @('v[5]').</p>

<p>Regardless of how the range is written, the wire behaves the same as far as
operations like addition, concatenation, and so forth are concerned.  This
might seem pretty surprising.  For instance,</p>

@({
wire [3:0] a = 4'b0001;
wire [0:3] b = 4'b1000;
wire [7:0] c = {a, b};
})

<p>Results in @('c') having the value @('8'b 0001_1000').  Basically the way
that the bits of @('b') are represented doesn't affect its value as an integer,
and when we just write @('b') we're referring to that value.</p>

<p>Where it <i>does</i> matter is when bits or parts are selected from the
wire.  That is, @('b[0]') is 1 since its indices go from low to high.</p>")

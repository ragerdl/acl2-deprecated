For instance, if we replace @('{a+b}') with just @('a+b'), then we've lost the
fact that @('a+b') should be self-determined.  In general this wouldn't be safe
and could screw things up.</p>

<p>However, we found that we still wanted to carry out this reduction in places
where it <i>is</i> safe.  For instance, it seems okay to do this in the special
cases of bit- and part-selects: these expressions are always unsigned and,
e.g., there is no difference between extending @('{foo[3]}') and @('foo[3]'),
since a zero-extension is necessary in either case.</p>

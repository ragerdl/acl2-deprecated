  :short "Synthesize simple edge-triggered @('always') blocks into primitives."

  :long "<p>This is our \"final,\" transformation for synthesizing
edge-triggered always blocks into primitives.  This transform supports only a
limited subset of Verilog statements.  Generally speaking, VL can handle a much
richer subset of Verilog statements than we are going to deal with here.  Other
@(see transforms)&mdash;e.g., @(see stmtrewrite), @(see caseelim), and @(see
edgesplit)&mdash;are typically first used to reduce these much richer
statements into the simple form that we now target.</p>

<p>Despite the many limits we place on the Verilog statements that we do try to
support here, synthesizing edge-triggered always blocks is still difficult to
do in a way that is completely faithful to the Verilog semantics.  We describe
some of the challenges and our general approach below.</p>


<h3>Preliminaries: Edge-Triggered Blocks, Clocks</h3>

<p><u>Definition.</u> We say that an @('always') block is <b>edge-triggered</b>
when it contains a <see topic='@(url timing-statements)'>timing-statement</see>
whose control is a list of @('posedge') or @('negedge') events.  As
examples:</p>

@({
 always @(posedge clk) ... ;                  // edge-triggered
 always @(negedge clk) ... ;                  // edge-triggered
 always @(posedge clk or negedge reset) ... ; // edge-triggered

 always @(*) ... ;                            // not edge-triggered
 always @(a or b or c) ... ;                  // not edge-triggered
 always @(posedge clk or a) ... ;             // not edge-triggered
 always #3 ... ;                              // not edge-triggered
 always begin ... end ;                       // not edge-triggered
})

<p>Throughout this discussion, we will assume that we are attempting to
synthesize an edge-triggered always block.  Some other kinds of @('always')
blocks are supported by other VL transforms, e.g., the @(see cblock) transform
can process certain kinds of combinational always blocks.  But we aren't going
to try to cover any of that, here.</p>

<p>For many years, VL only supported edge-triggered always blocks that had a
single @('posedge') or @('negedge') trigger.  We now support arbitrary lists of
@('posedge') and @('negedge') edges.  That is, we can now handle always blocks
such as:</p>

@({
 always @(posedge a or negedge b or posedge c or ...)
 begin
    // restricted statements as explained below
 end
})

<p><u>Definition</u>.  We say that the <b>clocks</b> of such an always block
are the expressions in the sensitivity list, regardless of whether they are
used with @('posedge') or @('negedge') specifiers.  For instance:</p>

@({
 // example:                                  // clocks (expressions)
 always @(posedge clk) ...;                   //   clk
 always @(posedge mclk or negedge reset) ...; //   mclk, reset
 always @(posedge a & b or posedge c[0]) ...; //   a & b, c[0]
})

<p>We only support always blocks whose clocks are each <b>one-bit wide, plain
identifiers</b>.  Why?</p>

<ul>

<li>The width restriction is meant to avoid mismatches between Verilog tools:
we have found that various Verilog simulators do not agree about what
constitutes an edge for a wide signal.  At any rate, it would be weird to ask
about the edge of a wide signal.</li>

<li>Requiring the clock be a plain identifier is a significant help in keeping
our processing code more simple.  We'll soon describe some of the timing
nuances that make it important to be able to distinguishing clocks from
non-clocks in @('if') statements and right-hand sides of expressions.  We think
this restriction is probably not too severe, as most reasonable designs will
not include, e.g., vectors of clocks.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Synthesis Challenge: X Optimism</h3>

<p>One basic problem in synthesizing edge-triggered @('always') blocks (or any
other kind of @('always') blocks, for that matter) is the unwarranted optimism
of @('if') statements.</p>

<p>Suppose for simplicity that @('en') is one bit wide.  In the Verilog
semantics, a statement like @('if (en) q <= d') causes an update to @('q') only
if @('en') evaluates to 1.  If @('en') instead evaluates to X or Z, the @('if')
statement <b>pretends it evaluated to 0</b> and does not update @('q').  This
is generally bad, as it fails to properly treat X as an unknown.</p>

<p>When we synthesize these always blocks for use with properly monotonic
back-ends like @(see esim), where X really does represent an unknown, we have
no way to model this kind of optimism.  Instead, roughly speaking, we are going
to treat these statements like @('?:') operators, which have safer but
different X behavior.  That is, in our semantics, when @('en') evaluates to X
or Z, we may write an X value into @('q') instead of failing to update it.</p>

<p>We cannot see any way to avoid this kind of mismatch.  We generally regard
the @('?:') behavior as more reasonable and safer.  But it's easy to imagine
that if @('q') is later fed into other, non-conservative Verilog
constructs (such as if statements, case/casex/casez statements, case equality
operators, etc.), then a Verilog simulator could go produce completely
different results than, say, an esim-based simulation.</p>


<h3>Synthesis Challenge: Clock/Data Races</h3>

<p>A much more subtle and tricky problem is the event-based Verilog timing
model allows for a number of races between the clock signals and the data
inputs.  To illustrate this, consider the following examples:</p>

@({
    // Version 1:

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
      q <= reset ? 0 : data;

    // Version 2:

    wire q_next;
    assign q_next = reset ? 0 : data;
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
      q <= q_next;
})

<p>You might hope these would behave the same.  After all, it looks like the
only difference is that we've named an intermediate expression.  Unfortunately,
Version 2 has a race condition in Verilog simulators.  In Version 2, when
@('reset') transitions from low to high, two separate events need to be
scheduled: the @('assign') and the @('always') block.  These events may occur
in any order, so we may find that either:</p>

<ul>

<li>The @('assign') statement happens first, so @('q_next') \"properly\" is
updated to 0 before the @('always') block updates @('q'), or</li>

<li>The @('always') statement happens first, so @('q_next') \"improperly\" has
the old value of @('data') when we assign it to @('q').</li>

</ul>

<p>(If you run these on a Verilog simulator and find that they simulate in the
same way, try reordering the assignment and the always block and you may get a
different result.)</p>

<p>In contrast, at least in Verilog's simulation semantics, Version 1 does not
suffer from this problem and will \"properly\" reset @('q').  The reason this
works is that there are no competing events are triggered by the transition of
@('reset'); only the single @('always') block must be run.</p>

<p>Here is an attempt to visualize what we might be modeling when we write
these two fragments of Verilog.</p>

<img src='edgesynth_reset.png'/>

<p>(BOZO we need some way to add some kind of \"asset directories\" to XDOC, so
we can handle things like images in a coherent way.)</p>

<p>Version 1 might be sensible.  If this handling of @('reset') is to be an
intrinsic part of the always block, a circuit designer might be able to design
something that implements it correctly.</p>

<p>But Version 2 is clearly not okay.  Here, with the muxing done independently
of the flop, we can see that a change in reset is going to trigger an update in
both the flop itself and in the mux that is feeding the flop.  This is a clear
race.</p>

<p>The fanciful \"horrible circuit\" is similar to Version 2, but made worse
just to drive the point home.  Imagine here that the adder is some large
circuit with some large delay.  When reset goes high, the flip-flop is
triggered and, meanwhile, the adder's inputs have changed, so it will be busily
transitioning to compute the new sum.  The value that gets latched in, then, is
anyone's guess.  Clearly you would never want to design something like
this.</p>

<p>At any rate, if we regard the right-hand sides of assignments in an
edge-triggered always block as the data inputs to flip-flops, then for our
design to make any sense, we really need these data inputs to be stable
whenever a clock changes.  For that to hold, these assignments should, at the
very least, <b>not depend on the clocks</b> of the always block.</p>

<p>This is difficult to reliably identify syntactically.  Even in a simple case
like Version 2, we would need to analyze the assignments that are occurring in
the module to discover that @('q_next') depends on @('reset').  If @('q_next')
were instead driven by some submodule, then noticing this would require an
analysis of that submodule.  Aliasing makes this much worse, e.g., what if we
have something like:</p>

@({
     wire my_clk = real_clk;
     always @(posedge my_clk) q <= real_clk;
})

<p>At any rate, detecting this situation seems very difficult, so we have not
seriously considered trying to identify these races.  We do, however, at least
forbid the clocks from occurring in the right hand sides of expressions.</p>

<p>This may seem quite unsatisfying&mdash;it rules out Version 1 and doesn't
rule out Version 2!  But this restriction is practically very useful.  It means
that for the blocks we <i>do</i> support, it's reasonable to move the
right-hand sides out of the always block.  That is, it makes it safe to do
something like:</p>

@({
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
      if (reset)
         q <= 0;
      else
         q <= q+1;
    -->

    assign q_next = q+1;

    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
      if (reset)
         q <= 0;
      else
         q <= q_next;
})

<p>This sort of reassignment wouldn't be valid if the right-hand side
expression mentioned any of the clocks, as we have just beaten to death,
above.  (It's the whole difference between Version 1 and Version 2).</p>


<h3>Historic Approach to Edge-Triggered Blocks</h3>

<p>Before describing our new approach, it's useful to describe the old way that
VL handled edge-triggered blocks.  Previously, VL supported only basic,
single-edge registers, and reduced all supported always blocks into instances
of a single, 1-bit flip-flop primitive.</p>

@({
    module VL_1_BIT_FLOP (q, d, clk);
      output reg q;
      input d;
      input clk;
      always @(posedge clk)
        q <= d;
    endmodule
})

<p>Given this primitive, it was straightforward to implement a simple,
posedge-triggered, <i>N</i>-bit flip-flop: just instance <i>N</i> of these
primitive flops, one for each bit.  We named the resulting modules, e.g.,
@('VL_4_BIT_FLOP'), @('VL_128_BIT_FLOP'), and so forth, for any <i>N</i>.</p>

<p>We then had a transformation that could support basic @('always') blocks by
converting them into instances of an appropriately sized flop module.  For
instance:</p>

@({
    always @(posedge clk)
      q <= a + b + cin;
     --->
    VL_12_BIT_FLOP foo123 (q, a + b + cin, clk);
})

<p>Our transform could also support always blocks with limited if/else
expressions, by merging the if/else structure into the data input.  For
instance:</p>

@({
    always @(posedge clk)
    begin
      if (cycle)
         q <= 12'b0;
      else
         q <= a + b + cin;
    end
    --->
    VL_12_BIT_FLOP foo123 (q, cycle ? 12'b0 : a + b + cin, clk);
})

<p>Along with other transforms, e.g., for converting @('negedge') into posedge
signals by inverting them, this allowed VL to support a fairly rich set of
single-edge always blocks.  Meanwhile, back-end tools like @(see esim) only
needed to support a single VL_1_BIT_FLOP primitive.  Historically this was done
using a traditional master/slave latch style.</p>


<h3>New Primitives</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't how we can construct a multi-edge flip flop out of a
single-edge flip-flop.  To allow VL to support @('always') blocks with multiple
edges, then, we need new primitives.</p>

<p>After studying the kinds of multi-edge flops that we wanted to support, we
decided that what we really want is a flip-flop with a built-in priority mux
that is governed by the clock edges.  Our new, simplest flip-flop primitive is
just like the previous VL_1_BIT_FLOP:</p>

@({
    module VL_1_BIT_1_EDGE_FLOP (q, d, clk);
      output reg q;
      input d;
      input clk;
      always @(posedge clk)
        q <= d;
    endmodule
})

<p>The next simplest primitive has two clocks and two data signals.  We assume
that one clock has priority over the other.  This module is just a slight
generalization of, e.g., Version 1 of the resettable mux that we saw above,
where instead of necessarily resetting to zero we can choose between two
arbitrary data inputs.</p>

@({
    module VL_1_BIT_2_EDGE_FLOP (q, d0, d1, clk0, clk1);
     output reg q;
     input d0, d1;
     input clk0, clk1;
     always @(posedge clk0 or posedge clk1)
       if (clk0)
          q <= d0
       else
          q <= d1;
    endmodule
})

<p><b>BOZO</b> consider using ?: instead of IF here for the Verilog definition.</p>

<p>For three clocks we simply add another clock and data input, extending the
priority mux.  This module could be used to model, e.g., a flip-flop with
asynchronous set and clears, e.g., by allowing @('d0 = 1') and @('d1 = 0') or
vice versa depending on the desired priority of set versus clear.</p>

@({
    module VL_1_BIT_3_EDGE_FLOP (q, d0, d1, d2, clk0, clk1, clk2);
     output reg q;
     input d0, d1;
     input clk0, clk1;
     always @(posedge clk0 or posedge clk1 or posedge clk2)
       if (clk0)
          q <= d0
       else if (clk1)
          q <= d1;
       else
          q <= d2;
    endmodule
})

<p>Although we don't know what use there would be for such a flip-flop with
more than three clocks and data inputs, we can continue this way, adding more
clocks and data inputs, up to any number desired.  See @(see nedgeflop) for
more details about how we generate these primitives.</p>

<p>Given these new primitives, we can still construct wide flip-flops by
chaining together one-bit primitive flops.</p>

<p>The remaining challenge is to line up edge-triggered @('always') with
instances of these primitives.</p>")

  :long "<p>This is a basic assignment-propagation simplification.  The idea is
to reduce modules that have lots of intermediate wires by just replacing the
wire with its expression.  For instance, a module that had assignments
like:</p>

@({
    assign a1 = ~a2;
    assign a2 = ~a3;
    assign a3 = ~a4;
    assign a4 = ~a5;
})

<p>Could presumably be propagated into:</p>

@({
    assign a1 = ~(~(~(~a5)));
})

<p>Which we could then reduce in other ways.</p>

<p>This transformation is <b>generally unsound</b>.  We aren't really doing any
checking to make sure that we are substituting into contexts with compatible
widths, etc.  We're also relying on the :DIR fields on module instance
arguments, which is probably not safe when ports are incorrectly marked as
inputs instead of outputs, etc.</p>

<p>Prerequisites: arguments need to be resolved so we can tell directions on
module/gate instance ports.</p>")

assignment to a wire that is ever selected from.  The goal is to avoid having
to deal with things like this:</p>

@({
    assign foo = a + b;
    assign bar = foo[2] + 3;
})

<p>Naive propagation of foo would result in:</p>

@({
    assign bar = (a + b)[2] + 3;
})

<p>And we don't want to try to think about how to handle this.  Even if we just
had something like assign foo = bar, it'd be complicated because foo/bar could
have different ranges, e.g., if we have</p>

@({
    wire [3:0] foo;
    wire [4:1] bar;
    assign foo = bar;
    assign baz = foo[2] + 3;
})

<p>Then we would need to be careful to fix up the indicides when substituting
into baz, i.e., the correct substitution would be:</p>

@({
    assign baz = bar[3] + 3;
})

<p>And that's getting tricky.  So, the basic idea is: if the wire is ever
selected from anywhere, then just don't try to propagate it.</p>

<p>Also, for propagation to be safe, we need to make sure that we are not
propagating wires that have multiple drivers.  For instance, if we had:</p>

@({
    assign A = B;
    assign A = C;
})

<p>Then it wouldn't be safe to just go around replacing uses of A with either B
or C, because neither B nor C captures the whole value being assigned to A.
Hence, we need some code for detecting what wires are driven.</p>

<p>Another new restriction: we now allow ourselves to propagate into modules
that have always blocks, initial blocks, and function declarations.  But to
hopefully make this safe, we consider any names that are actually used in these
places to be unsafe.</p>"

(defxdoc selfassigns
  :parents (checkers)
  :short "Simple check for self-assignments."

  :long "<p>This is just a heuristic check that adds warnings if it sees
assignments where some bit is on both the left- and right-hand sides.  For
instance, it would warn about something like this:</p>

@({
 assign foo = a ? b : foo;
})

<p>Such assignments might be combinational loops.  Of course, most
combinational loops are not so simple, and this is just an extremely stupid
check that will only catch the most obvious problems.</p>

<p>I started by just seeing how bad it would be if I just gathered names on
both side of the expression using vl-expr-names to gather up the names.  But
that produced too much noise about assignments like @({foo[1] =
foo[0]}).</p>

<p>So I now essentially collect up the bits of expressions, fudging for
bit/part selects that aren't resolved.  If this is done only after ranges are
resolved, it is still pretty good.  But it needs to be done before expressions
are split, etc.</p>

<p>This found only two things at Centaur, one of which was an assignment of an
otherwise-unused wire to itself, and one which was not actually a problem because
essentially it had the form:</p>

@({
assign {foo, bar} = {baz, foo};
})")

(defines vl-expr-approx-bits
  :short "Collect strings representing (approximately) the individual bits of
wires involved in an expression."

  :long "<p>We try to return a list of strings like @('\"foo[3]\"') that are
approximately the bits indicated by the expression.  This routine is at the
core of our @(see selfassigns) check, which is just an informal heuristic and
doesn't need to be particularly correct or accurate.</p>

<p>This is mostly similar to the @(see vl-wirealist-p) facilities, but we trade
some accuracy to be especially forgiving.  We don't really try to avoid name
clashes that could be caused by using escaped identifiers.  We also correct for
other errors in some questionable ways:</p>

<ul>

<li>If we encounter an unresolved bit- or part-select from @('w'), or if we
encounter a plain @('w') that is not defined, we just return
@('\"w[0]\"').</li>

<li>We don't do any index checking, so if we see an out-of-bounds bit- or
part-select we just return strings that refer to non-existent bits.</li>

<li>If we encounter a plain, undefined wire @('w'), we just return
@('\"w[0]\"').</li>

</ul>

<p>It is somewhat <i>wrong</i> to fudge like this, but these cases won't be hit
in well-formed modules, and they allow us to handle expressions even in
malformed modules in a mostly correct way without having to consider how to
handle problems with collecting bits.</p>"

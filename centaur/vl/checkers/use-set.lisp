  :short "Tool for detecting unused and unset wires."

  :long "<p><b>USE-SET</b> is a simple tool for detecting wires which may be
unset or unused.  This is a primitive, static analysis that can be carried out
on the Verilog source tree.</p>

<p><b>Unset</b> wires are those which have no values flowing into them. An
unset wire should satisfy the following properties:</p>

<ol>
 <li>No \"assign\" statement is assigning a value to it, and</li>
 <li>It is not in any submodule's output (\"driven from below\")</li>
 <li>It is not a primary input (\"driven from above\")</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Unused</b> wires are those whose values are not sent anywhere. An unused
wire should satisfy the following properties:</p>

<ol>
 <li>It is not in the RHS of any assignment</li>
 <li>It is not in any submodule's input (\"possibly used below\")</li>
 <li>It is not a primary output (\"possibly used above\")</li>
</ol>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<ul>

<li>USE-SET does not currently look at always or initial statements. If wires
are only used or set in these statements, they may not be reported
correctly.</li>

<li>USE-SET is not at all clever: it will not realize that @('bar') is unused
in code such as @('assign foo = 1'b0 & bar;') or @('assign foo = {0
{bar}};')</li>

<li>USE-SET does not know about the C code that implements RAM modules in
speedsim, etc., and will think that such wires are unset.</li>

<li>USE-SET does not consider the individual bits of a vector. For instance, if
you just write:

@({
wire [7:0] foo;
assign foo[0] = 1'b0;
})

It treats the entire wire @('foo') as set, even though @('foo[0]') is the only
bit that has really been set.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p>To carry out the analysis, our high-level approach is as follows.  For each
module, we construct a fast alist that associates each wire with a VL-WIREINFO
object.  This info object includes boolean flags that indicate whether the
wire has been used or set.  Then, we simply walk over this alist to print out
any wires which are either unused or unset.  We imagine that we may eventually
want to add additional kinds of information here.</p>")

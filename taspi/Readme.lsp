 (:ABSTRACT
"This directory contains code relating to TASPI (Tree Analysis System for 
Phylogenetic Inference).  TASPI is specialized code for modeling collections
of phylogenetic trees and performing a few manipulations such as 
consensus analysis. Please note: TASPI relies on a version of ACL2 that 
includes HONS for its speed and memory requirement claims.

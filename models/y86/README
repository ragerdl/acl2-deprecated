This directory contains subdirectories for y86 models, as described
below.  See the file, LICENSE, for copyright and authorship
information.

Each top-level subdirectory has a README file containing more
information.

Current contents:

y86-basic/
	A very simple microprocessor model for the Y86 ISA,
	which is an X86-like ISA

y86-two-level/
	A variant of y86-basic/ that uses space-efficient memory

y86-two-level-abs/
	A variant of y86-two-level/ that uses abstract stobjs for
	reasoning and execution efficiency (thus, this is a variant of
	y86-basic/ that uses both space-efficient memory and abstract
	stobjs)

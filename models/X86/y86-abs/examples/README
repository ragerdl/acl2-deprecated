The book popcount.lisp contains alternate definitions of popcount,
proofs of their equivalence to the built-in logcount (basically
demonstrating what kinds of things GL can do), and proofs
of correctness of the Y86 popcount binary.

The book popcount-demo.lisp is smaller than popcount.lisp.  It
contains the same proofs of correctness of the Y86 popcount binary
(with the theorems named differently).  The book popcount-demo.lisp
serves the purpose of a demo --- it has fewer events than
popcount.lisp.

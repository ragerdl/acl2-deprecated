The x86-y86 books contain an ACL2-based specification of the Y86
microprocessor which is described in "Computer Systems, A
Programmer's Perspective" by Bryant and O'Hallaron.  The Y86 is a
very simple microprocessor, with an X86-like ISA.  Among other
things, its state consists of 8 32-bit general purpose registers, a
32-bit instruction counter, a 32-bit flags register, and a
double-word (32-bit) addressable memory of size 4 GB.  When loaded
into ACL2, these books provide a running simulator of the Y86
microprocessor design.

Subdirectories in x86-y86:
======================================================================

common: contains books that define the Y86 state, and read-over-write
        theorems about the components of the state.

y86:    contains books that define the instruction interpreter for the
        Y86, and an assembler for the Y86 simulator.

py86:   contains an early proof by symbolic simulation using Sol
        Swords' GL package, superseded by the use of abstract stobjs;
        see the README file for more information.

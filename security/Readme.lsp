 (:TITLE    "A gathering point for ACL2 books that model security protocols")

 (:AUTHOR/S "David L. Rager")

 (:KEYWORDS "jfkr" "security")

 (:ABSTRACT
"While theorem proving is considered by many of us to be related to
security, the goal of the books in this directory is to share libraries
that specifically analyze security protocols and related components.

Note that there are no Readme.lsp files for the subdirectories since the
subdirectories are captured by this Readme.lsp")

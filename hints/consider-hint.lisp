; Essay on the Design of Consider Hints

; Implementation of Consider Hint Processing!]

; :hints (("Goal" ...
;                 :CONSIDER 
;                 ((<name> 
;                   [:pattern <term> | :lhs ]
;                   [:target  <term> | :conclusion ]
;                   [:instance <var-substn>]
;                   [:functional-instance <fn-substn>]
;                  )
;                  ...)
;                 ...)

; The new hint will use second-order matching to compute a relevant
; instantiation of <name> and that instantiation is added as a hypothesis,
; as when we supply :USE hints.

; The value of the :consider hint denotes a list of
; ``considerations.''

; The user-level form of a consideration is

;                 (<name> 
;                  [:pattern <term> | :lhs ]
;                  [:target  <term> | :conclusion | :clause]
;                  [:instance <var-substn>]
;                  [:functional-instance <fn-substn>)]
;                  )
; or just <name>.

; We describe below some conventions for abbreviating a list of
; considerations.

; The :pattern specifies the pat used in second order matching.  It is
; either a term or the keyword :lhs.  The latter means ``use the lhs
; of the conclusion of <name>.''  If :pattern is not specified, it
; defaults to :lhs.

; The :target specifies the concrete term to match.  If it is
; :conclusion, we SEARCH through the conclusion of the subgoal clause
; for the first match of :pattern.  If it is :clause, we SEARCH
; through the clause, from last literal to the first literal, for the
; first match of :pattern.  If :target is :term, we use term and we
; don't search, we just match against term itself.  If :target is not
; specified, it defaults to :clause.

; :Instance and :functional-instance specify substitutions in the
; usual form that users write them, e.g., lists of doublets.  The
; first is a var-to-term substitution, the second is a
; function-symbol-to-function substitution.  They are combined into a
; mixed substitution that is used by the second order pattern matcher
; as the starting substitution.  That substitution must be extended in
; the match.  This is a way to limit the possible matches.

; If either substitution is not specified, it defaults to nil.

; If no keywords are specified, all default as described.

; We must decide how to handle user-level input that denotes a list of
; considerations.  For example, if the user writes :consider h-thm it
; means :consider (h-thm).  If the user writes :consider (h-thm
; :pattern ...) it means :consider ((h-thm :pattern ...)).  But if the
; user writes :consider (h-thm g-thm) it means just that: h-thm and
; g-thm are two considerations.  See coerce-consideration-list.
; 
; Translation-Time Processing: We check that <name> is a named
; formula.  Each <term> is translated.  If :lhs is written, we replace
; it by the translated lhs of the named formula, so :lhs will NEVER
; appear in a translated :consider hint.  If :conclusion or :clause is
; written, we leave it as written, since we cannot resolve it until we
; see the goal clause.  The two substitutions are combined at
; translate-time into a single psubst.

; Prove-Time Processing: Most of the work on :consider hints occurs at
; prove-time, when we use second order matching between the :pattern
; and the :target term of the subgoal clause to generate a list of
; substitutions.  We rank the substitutions by syntactic criteria and
; choose the most highly ranked substitutions and produce the
; corresponding lemma instance, lmi.  We do this for each of the
; consideration items listed.  We are supposed to use one of the lmi's
; from each of the items.  So we use all-picks to convert what is
; essentially a conjunction of disjuncts to a disjunction of
; conjuncts.  Each list of lmi's is now an UNtranslated :USE hint and
; we will search for the first one that works.  To do that, we convert
; each of these automatically generated :USE hints into internal form
; (analogous to the translation-time processing of :USE hints, but
; done in the waterfall without state), and then successively replace
; the :CONSIDER hint by the :USE hints and proceed.

; We anticipate that users might ultimately wish to see ALL of the
; candidate substitutions generated.  After all, we choose only the
; most highly ranked ones and our rankings are entirely syntactic.  We
; could have preserved all that information and included it in our
; normal output, but we decided that was too complicated and verbose.
; Instead, we expect to implement a diagnostic feature like
; show-all-matches that takes two terms, or a clause and consider
; item, and prints all of the matches.

  an object indicating that some instantiation is relevant~/

  Considerations are the objects one provides as part of ~c[:consider]
  ~il[hints].  The most convenient form of a consideration is simply the name
  of a lemma.  The system will then search for a relevant instantiation of the
  left-hand side of the conclusion of that lemma inside the specified goal
  clause, starting with the last literal.  The system uses a heuristically
  modified version of the Huet-Lang second-order pattern matching algorithm
  and, in general, produces instantiations of both variable symbols and
  constrained function symbols in the lemma.  If an instance is found, the
  consideration is turned into a ~il[lemma-instance] and ~c[:use]d.

  For example, suppose the following theorem has been proved:
  ~bv[]
  (defthm map-h-append
    (implies (and (true-listp x)
                  (true-listp y))
             (equal (map-h-append (append x y))
                    (append (map-h x) (map-h y))))
    :rule-classes nil)
  ~ev[]
  and suppose ~c[map-h] is a defined function involving some constrained
  function symbol ~c[h].  Then the consideration ~c[map-h-append]
  attached to a clause identifier will cause the system to find the
  identified clause and search through it for an instance and/or functional
  instance of ~c[(map-h-append (append x y))] and to add that (functional) 
  instance as a hypothesis when it finds it.  If no instance is found, an
  error is signalled.  The more elaborate form of a consideration allows
  you to specify what is used as the pattern and where that pattern
  is searched for in the clause.~/

  The most general form of a consideration is
  ~bv[]
   (name
    :pattern             pterm   ; term or :lhs
    :target              tterm   ; term or :conclusion or :clause
    :instance            vsubst  ; variable substitution
    :functional-instance fsubst) ; functional substitution
  ~ev[]
  where ~c[name] is the name of a previously proved theorem, ~c[pterm] is
  either a term or the keyword ~c[:lhs], ~c[tterm] is either a term or the
  keyword ~c[conclusion] or the keyword ~c[:clause], ~c[vsubst] is a variable
  substitution as might be given in an ~c[:instance], e.g.,
  ~c[((x (rev a)) (y (sort b)))], and ~c[fsubst] is a functional substitution
  as might be given in a ~c[:functional-instance], e.g., ~c[((map-h sumer))].

  If ~c[pterm] is a term, that term is used as the pattern we try to
  instantiate.  If ~c[pterm] is the keyword ~c[:lhs], the left-hand side
  of the conclusion of ~c[name] is used as the pattern.  If no ~c[:pattern]
  is specified, ~c[:lhs] is used by default.

  If ~c[tterm] is a term, that term is matched against the pattern to generate
  the instantiation.  If ~c[tterm] is ~c[:conclusion], a match of the pattern
  is searched for in the conclusion of the specified subgoal clause.  If
  ~c[tterm] is ~c[:clause], a match of the pattern is searched for in the
  entire subgoal clause, starting with the conclusion and searching backwards
  toward the first hypothesis.  The search is outer-most first, left-to-right
  recursive descent.  The first subterm of the target producing a match of the
  pattern stops the search and generates the instantiation.  Note that if
  ~c[tterm] is given explicitly, no search occurs.  Note also that because we
  cannot do the search until we know what the subgoal clause is, the work for
  this hint -- the Huet-Lang second-order matching algorithm -- cannot
  commence until the indicated subgoal arises.

  The substitutions produced by second-order matching are what we called
  ``mixed substitutions'' by which we mean a given substitution will
  substitute both for variable symbols and hereditarily constrained
  function symbols.  The effect, however, is the same as
  ~bv[]
  (:INSTANCE (:FUNCTIONAL-INSTANCE name (fn1 (lambda ...)) ...)
             (var1 term1)
             ...).
  ~ev[]

  Second-order matching typically produces a plethora of such substitutions.
  We rule many out on heuristic grounds.  Thus, our heuristic modification of
  the Huet-Lang algorithm makes it incomplete.  Still, it is typical for a lot
  of substitutions to be found and the system selects some to pursue in an
  DISJUNCTIVE way.  That is, it takes each of the ``winning'' substitutions
  and generates a ~c[:use] hint for each of them separately to see if any one
  of them will prove the indicated subgoal.

  It is frequently necessary to give the matcher a ``hint'' to limit its
  consideration of all possible substitutions.  The ~c[vsubst] and ~c[fsubst]
  are treated as ``seed'' substitutions.  Any computed instance is an
  extension of the two seeds.  That is, the variable pairs in the mixed
  substitutions extend ~c[vsubst] and the functional pairs in the mixed
  substitutions extend ~c[fsubst].  Both ~c[vsubst] and ~c[fsubst]
  default to ~c[nil].

; --------------
; Essay on the Implementation of Consider Hint Processing

; We are about to start dealing with the conversion of considerations
; to :use hints.  A use hint is a list of lemma instances and in our
; case each is of the form (:instance (:functional-instance ...) ...).

; Let temp be (:consider . (consideration1
; ... considerationn)), where each consideration is a record of that
; type.  Naively, each consideration generates a lemma instance and we
; conjoin them all together across the n considerations.

; But less naively, each considerationi may generate multiple lemma
; instances (because of the multiplicity of functional instantiations
; produced by second order matching).  Thus, the list of n
; considerations represents a conjunction of disjunctions.  If
; consideration1 generates u1,1 ... u1,k1, where each u is a lemma
; instance, then we have (and (or u1,1 ... u1,k1) (or u2,1 ... u2,k2)
; ...) and we want a disjunction of conjunctions: (or (and u1,1 u2,1
; ...) (and u1,1 u2,2 ...) ...).  This transformation to DNF form is
; just performed by all-picks.  Thus, we get k1*k2*... disjunctions,
; each of which represents a conjunction of lemma instances.  But a
; conjunction of lemma instances is a :USE hint.  Thus we ultimately
; produce a hint of the form

; :OR ((:USE (u1,1 u2,1 ...)) (:USE (u1,1 u2,2 ...)) ...)

; We go back and forth between the internal and external form of
; substitutions in this code, so we need these two functions.

; I have marked with (i-am-here) various questions worthy of
; additional work.

; Second-Order Matching Under a Set of Rewriting Rules

; I implement the second-order matching algorithm of Huet and Lang and
; then couple it with a search strategy that generates and tests ``all
; possible rewrites'' under a particular set of rewrite rules.  The
; original intent of this work was to devise a way to automatically
; recognize functional instantiations.  But in addition, I want to be
; able to use it to recognize recursion schemes.  For example, I would
; like to ask ``does this defun body match the scheme
;   (IF (test x) (tweak (REC (step x))) (base x))?''
; and have it tell me "yes" even when the body in question is 
;   (IF (ENDP X) 0 (ADD1 (REC (CDR X)))).
; Note that the actual body reverses the parity of the test and
; matches the given scheme under the equality (if x y z) = (if (not x)
; z y).

; The basic second-order matching algorithm will, unfortunately, match
; the bodies above by letting tweak be the constant 0 and base be the
; (add1 (rec (cdr x))) part.  The trouble is that we need to
; communicate to the matching algorithm that base is not allowed to
; call REC.  This means we will add a mild extension to the Huet-Lang
; algorithm in which we prohibit certain otherwise legal solutions.
; (i-am-here)
; One might ask ``why not generate them all and then throw out the
; unwanted ones?''  Indeed, that might be a good idea.  But because of
; our generate-and-test strategy with equalities the production of an
; ``unwanted'' solution makes the ``generate'' phase stop before it
; ever produces the acceptable version of the term.  But I could
; use pure HL matching and then reject the unwanted solution at the
; top (insde eriapw1) instead of in the middle of HL.  This might clean
;  up our code somewhat.

; Also in this file I use the HL matcher to explore some automatic
; functional instantiations and propose some heuristics for grading
; the many alternative matches that result.

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Huet-Lang Matching - Preliminaries for Basic Algorithm

; We start by developing the Huet-Lang algorithm.

; For a description of the basic algorithm, see "Automatically
; Computing Functional Instantiations," in Proceedings of the ACL2
; Workshop 2009(eds. D. Russinoff and S. Ray), Boston, 2009, URL
; http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/moore-09a.pdf .
; That is my rendition of G. Huet and B. Lang, ``Proving and applying
; program transformations expressed with second-order patterns,'' Acta
; Informatica, 11, pp 31--55, 1997.

; In this implementation, higher order terms will be like terms but
; some ``function symbols'' will be integers.  Such ``function
; symbols'' denote second-order variables, e.g., h_i, and will be
; called ``function variables.''  Substitutions will sometimes pair
; these function variables with lambda expressions.  When we
; substitute lambda expressions for function variables we will also use
; integers for the formals, to save the bother of creating symbols.
; Thus, we will be dealing with such ``terms'' as 
; ((lambda (1 2) (1 1 2)) A B)
; which beta reduces to (1 A B).

; Not all functional variables will be integers.  Only the h_i of
; Huet-Lang will be integers.  The constrained functions of the
; pattern will be treated as functional variables also.  They retain
; their normal symbolp names.  Thus, a term like (X X), where X is a
; constrained function, is problematic.  X, as a function symbol, may
; be bound to a lambda expression and X, as a variable symbol, may be
; bound to a term.  To avoid this ambiguity, binding "pairs" are
; really triples: (pat fnp . val), where pat is an individual or
; functional variable, fnp is non-nil if pat is a functional
; variablep, and val is the binding.  Fnp can take on two values, T
; and DONE.  The value DONE is present pat is a constrained but
; undefined function or pat is a hereditarily constrained defined
; function that has been recursively explored by the one-way-unify
; process.

(defun is-boundp (var fnp bindings)
  (cond ((endp bindings) nil)
        ((and (equal var (caar bindings))
              (iff fnp (cadar bindings)))
         (car bindings))
        (t (is-boundp var fnp (cdr bindings)))))

(defmacro binding (trip) `(cddr ,trip))

; Substitutions always hit free variables, not bound ones.  So a
; substitution triple like (i fnp . x), where i is an integer, will
; always be a functional substitution and never be a substitution for
; the formal variable i.  That is, fnp will be non-nil in
; this case.  We do not optimize away this special case.

; It is actually unnecessary to cons up (lambda (1 2) (1 1 2)) since
; we will know (1 1 2) is a lambda expression.  In the rest of this
; file, we use the term ``lambda expression'' to mean the latter
; rather than the former, i.e., a term in which integers are used as
; ``variable symbols.''  Such an integer i denotes variable Vi and the
; term denotes an ACL2 lambda expression (LAMBDA (v1 ... vmax) term),
; for some integer max as large as any integer ``variable symbol'' in
; term.  Thus, (CONS 1 3) may denote (LAMBDA (V1 V2 V3 V4) (CONS V1
; V3)).  The actual arity of one of these abbreviated lambda's cannot
; be determined except by context.  We assume the original pattern and target
; are well-formed and use their function symbols with consistent arities.

; The function below shows how we do Beta reduction, given a
; pseudo-term containing integers among its variable symbols, and a
; list of arguments.  For example,
; (subst-by-position '(IF 1 1 3) '(a b c)) = '(IF A A C).

; Note:  The definition above exploits the fact that VARIABLEP is ATOM, not
; SYMBOLP and FCONS-TERM is just CONS and does not try to do anything fancy
; with the ``function symbol.''

; In our recursive decent through a matching problem we will keep a
; variable hmax, indicating the largest function variable in the
; problem.  Thus, when we generate new function variables to carry out
; the Imitation rule, we use hmax+1 as the first.

; Finally, in our recursive descent we will keep a list of bindings
; that will enable us to construct a winning substitution for a given
; matching problem.  Such a list of bindings is not quite a proper
; substitution because the substitutions of functional variables must
; be applied to the right-hand sides.  That is, we might construct a
; list of bindings like this:

; ((V NIL . (CAR A))
;  (3 T   . (REV 1))
;  (2 T   . (LEN 1))
;  (1 T   . (CONS (2 1) (3 2))))

; This would actually denote the mixed substitution

; ((V  . (CAR A))
;  (F1 . (LAMBDA (V1 V2) (CONS (LEN V1) (REV V2)))))

; We call the raw list of bindings a ``pseudo-substitution'' and will
; traffic in them exclusively.  But it will be possible to convert a
; pseudo-substitution to a substitution for use outside the
; second-order matcher.

; We will have to pass pseudo-substitutions to recursive calls of the
; matcher.  Thus it is convenient to know the hmax for each
; pseudo-substitution.  Thus, we will pair each pseudo-substitution
; with its hmax (in the car) and pass those objects around.  We call
; them ``psubsts''.

(defun nats-from-to (i j)
; (nats-from-to 1 3) = '(1 2 3)
  (cond ((and (integerp i)

; Minor Aside:  Restrictions on Bindings

; For reasons that will become obvious, we want to extend the basic
; Huet-Lang algorithm to allow the user to specify that the matching
; substitutions satisfy certain restrictions, e.g., that that the
; binding of a given variable not involve a given function symbol.  We
; may ultimately want to express these restrictions as predicates that
; are evaluated; but at the moment I only see the need for three so I
; hand-code them.  A ``restrictions'' list is an alist tripling
; variables (individual or functional), the flag NIL or T (to indicate
; whether this is an individual or functional var) with restrictions.
; A restriction is thus (var fnp . restriction).  The three
; restrictions we implement are:

; (:MUST-IMITATE fn)              - pterm is a pseudo-term, e.g., (CAR (1 X))
; (:MUST-NOT-CONTAIN fn1 ... fnk) - the fni are function symbols
; (:MUST-BE-VARIABLE)             - binding must be a variable symbol,
;                                   which means x has the form
;                                   (:CONSTANT var) actually.
; 
; The meaning of a restrictions list is that we never allow a binding
; that would violate the restrictions.  We check this by actually
; creating the newly proposed bindings, i.e., adding the new triple, and
; then calling a predicate to ``ok'' it.  We cannot check it one
; binding at a time because we frequently have to check other bindings
; than the restricted one.  E.g., if function variable 1 is not
; supposed to be bound to a term involving fn1 and function variable 1
; is bound to a pterm involving function variable 2, then 2 inherits
; the restriction.  Rather than modify the restrictions as we go, we
; just ask, every time we produce a new bindings list, whether
; function variable 1 (still) satisfies its restriction.

; it is bound as a variable in bindings, then it is bound to a ground term
; (individual variables always are).  So we nil out the bindings
; before asking whether any fns occur in the binding.  On the other
; hand, if pterm is an integer, then it can't be bound in bindings and
; so no fns occur in it.  The tricky thing here is that the integer
; pterms might actually BE bound in bindings!  But when 3, for
; example, is bound in bindings, then it is the function variable 3,

; Huet-Lang Matching - The Algorithm

; Here is the basic Huet-Lang second-order matching algorithm,
; extended with our notion of restrictions.

; Note: Pat is a term except it may have integers in some function
; symbol positions.  It is a pterm except that it never contains any
; integers in variable positions.  The only time integers appear in
; pterms is when the pterm is an abbreviated lambda and we never call
; hl-one-way-unify1 on a lambda body (without first having done beta
; reduction).

; Term is a term except that it may contain ``subterms'' of the form
; (:CONSTANT sym), where sym is a variable symbol.  Think of these
; subterms as Skolem constants, i.e., (sym).  Where do they come from
; and why are they there?  They are inserted into the term by
; convert-free-vars-to-constants, which replaces all (free) variables
; in the term by such constants.  Why do we use (:CONSTANT sym)
; instead of (sym)?  Because sym might be used as a function symbol in
; the term.  For example, if we converted (CONS A (A)) to (CONS (A)
; (A)) we would be making a mistake.  Why do we eliminate variables
; for constants?  The classic Huet-Lang algorithm produces lambda
; expressions that are closed.  That is, the only variables occurring
; in the body are the formals.  But in our functional instantiations
; we need to support lambda expressions such as (lambda (x y) (cons A
; x)) The basic problem with Huet-Lang is that when we match (f x)
; against A, say, the only match is to let f be the identity function
; and match x to A.  But if x cannot match A, we're hosed, as in (f
; '1) versus A.  But (f '1) does match (A), by letting f "imitate" (A)
; with (lambda (x) (A)).  So we need to use imitation when the
; first-order term is a variable.  But we cannot just dump the
; variable into the lambda body because then it appears to be bindable
; in subsequent matches.  We must replace the first order vars by
; constants of some form so they can get transported around in lambdas
; created by intermediate matches without getting confused with
; variables that occurred in the pattern originally.  Finally, we have
; to build the machinery to map these (:CONSTANT sym) expressions out
; and recover ACL2 terms.  That is tricky too because (lambda (x)
; (CONS x (:CONSTANT X))) cannot be converted to (lambda (x) (cons x
; x))!  We have to avoid capture by renaming the formals, e.g., to get
; (lambda (z) (cons z X)).

; Essay on Incompleteness: Our handling of quoted constants makes our
; matcher incomplete in the following sense.  We are acting like the
; concrete nest representing each constant is of depth 1, i.e., for
; every constant 'c there is a concrete constructor fc such that 'c is
; (fc).  But ``in reality,'' constants are composed of other
; constants.  So consider the matching problem (g x) versus '(0 . 0).
; Our code gives two solutions to this problem, one where x is the
; entire constant and g is the identity function, and the other where
; x is irrelevant and g is the constant function '(0 . 0).  But had we
; thought of '(0 . 0) as (cons (zero) (zero)) there would be five
; solutions, including one where x is (zero) and g is cons-onto-0,
; i.e., g := (lambda (v1) (cons v1 0)).  These solutions exploiting
; the internal structure of constants are missed by our code.

; It is thus possible that we will find NO solutions when in fact there are
; solutions.  Consider, for example, 

; (IF (g x) (g y) x) versus (IF '(0 . 0) '(1 . 0) '0).

; Here, IF is just a convenient, concrete 3-place symbol.  We find no
; solutions (see footnote below for a description of the process).
; But had we phrased the problem as

; (IF (g x) (g y) x) versus (IF (CONS (Z) (Z)) (CONS (ONE) (Z)) (Z))

; we would find a solution, namely let g be cons-onto-0 and let x be
; 0 and y be 1.

; Footnote: To try to match 

; (IF (g x) (g y) x) with (IF '(0 . 0) '(1 . 0) '0)

; we find two solutions to the first sub-problem, i.e., matching (g x)
; with '(0 . 0).  One of those lets g be the constant function '(0
; . 0), but that precludes us from solving the second sub-problem,
; i.e., matching (g y) with '(1 . 0).  The other solution to the first
; sub-problem is to let g be the identity and let x be '(0 . 0).  That
; allows us to solve the second sub-problem, but then we fail on the
; third because we need x to be '0, not '(0 . 0).

; Alist is a substitution in which some keys are paired with lambda
; expressions and others aren't.  Those keys paired with lambdas are
; (constrained) function symbols and those that aren't are individual
; variable symbols.  We instantiate term with this mixed substitution.
; We do it by first instantiating the individual variables.  Then we
; do a functional substitution with the lambda expressions.  We do it
; in this order because the functional instantiation may introduce
; free variables that are then hit by the individual var substitution.
; For example, consider the mixed substitution ((x . y) (f . (lambda
; (y) (cons x y)))) applied to (f x).  If we use the functional
; instantiation first, we get (cons x x) and then instantiate that
; with the variable substitution to get (cons y y).  If, on the other
; hand, we use the variable substitution first we get (f y) and then
; the functional instantiation produces (cons x y).

; Note that the notion of a mixed substitution precludes an entry like
; (F . EQUAL), since F would look like an individual variable.  We
; have to use (F . (LAMBDA (X Y) (EQUAL X Y))) to get that effect.

; Note: Recall that sublis-var and sublis-fn use cons-term to
; construct their answer terms and cons-term does computation on
; quoted constants.  Thus, while one might expect the instantiation of
; (binary-+ x x), when x is replaced by '2, to be (binary-+ '2 '2) it
; is actually '4.  Thus, this function is problematic if you're using
; it to check whether a substitution actually produces an instance
; identical to the desired target!

(defun hl-one-way-unify (pat term restrictions wrld)

; We determine whether there is a second-order instance of pat that
; matches term, respecting the given restrictions.  We treat all
; constrained functions in pat as instantiable.  We return a triple
; (mv flg psubst-lst mixed-subst-lst).  If flg is nil, no match is
; possible.  Else, mixed-subst-lst is a list of ``mixed
; substitutions'', each of which suffices to produce a match.  See
; sublis-mixed for a description of mixed substitutions.  Psubst-lst is 
; in 1:1 correspondence with mixed-subst-lst but is in the internal
; form.

; In particular, if psubst corresponds to one of the mixed
; substitutions, subst, then psubst is a pair, (hmax . bindings).  If
; subst substitutes a lambda expression for a function variable, then
; bindings substitutes a pseudo-term for that function symbol.  E.g.,
; subst may contain the pair (FN . (LAMBDA (X Y) (EQUAL X Y))) where
; bindings has (FN . (EQUAL 1 2)).  In addition, bindings contains
; additional pairs that substitute for function variables introduced
; by the matching process (the ``Hi'' of the Huet-Lang algorithm's
; Imitation rule); those introduced function vars have been eliminated
; in the mixed substitution.  The hmax for each psubst pair is the
; number of function variables in the corresponding bindings, the
; highest indexed function variable.  Together the hmax and bindings
; may be used by hl-one-way-unify1 to extend the match.

; 2. In functional-instantiation-notes.lisp I list a bunch of the uses

; I have ignored the use of constrained functions in the hyps, e.g.,
; ``pred'' in the first few problems below.  I don't have any good
; ideas about that, yet.

; Also, in the first few examples below, I match on the entire
; conclusion of the rule, as though I were trying to use it in a :by

; side, as though I were rewriting using the theorem about constrained
; functions.  There seem to be a lot more possible matches!

; Ranking Substitutions

; The lesson learned from these examples is that there are some
; plausible heuristic rules that allow me to discard (or at least give
; low priority to) some of the legal instantions.  

; I disfavor substitutions that do not bind all the functional
; variables

; I disfavor substitutions that use identity (projection) lambdas like
; (lambda (...x...) x).  The idea is that if the user saw fit to
; provide a constrained function it is odd not to use it.

; I disfavor substitutions that use lambdas that do not use all their
; formals.  Why did the user provide a formal if it is not used?

; I disfavor substitutions that use lambdas that unnecessarily
; use free vars.  For example, (lambda (x) (cons x A)) when
; (lambda (x) (cons x x)) would work.

; I cannot think of any rational way to codify these heuristics and so
; I just compute scores for each of them, where each score is a
; rational 0<=r<=1, and then sum them.  Perhaps someday I'll weight
; the scores or do other things to distinguish them.

; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Rewriting

; I am going to implement a general rewrite engine that applies a set of
; ``rules'' ``in all possible ways''.  It is good to understand what I DON'T
; provide.  
; (1) While many of the rules are equalities, e.g.,
;     (EQUAL (IF X Y Z) (IF (NOT X) Z Y))
;     I always use them as left-to-right rewriters.  Thus, ``all possible
;     ways'' does not include right-to-left use of the equalities!  If you
;     want that, you should add it as a rule.  The search strategy will
;     handle the looping.

; (2) Some of the rules are essentially metafunctions.  These are hand coded
;     but one could imagine proving them correct.  The metafunctions that are
;     provided are hard-wired in, in the sense that if a rule is
;     (:META FOLD-TO-ISOLATE)
;     then the function name FOLD-TO-ISOLATE must be coded into the apply-rule
;     function.  That is, this is not extensible by the user.

; (3) Since the rules loop or, more generally, do not terminate, there is no
;     absolute sense of ``all possible ways''.  So a counter is provided that
;     limits the number of times we iterate the rewriting process.

; In summary, I have implemented a fairly general ad hoc framework for
; applying a bunch of conflicting rules in all possible combinations
; (bounded by the counter).  But it is not as general as one might
; hope and the user is not allowed to extend it.  It is seen by me as
; a system-developer's tool that lets me easily fiddle with the rules I
; support without having to get into the internals of the search
; strategy again.

; The first :META rule I saw I needed does the following folding:
;  (if p (add1 (LEN (cdr x))) (add2 (LEN (cddr x))))
; is folded into:
;  ((lambda (p z) (if p (add1 z) (add2 z)))
;    p
;    (LEN (if p (cdr x) (cddr x))))
; I call this FOLD-TO-ISOLATE.

; The output has the advantage of having exactly one call of LEN in
; it, allowing the original expression to match with something like
; (tweak$ (LEN (step$ x))).  This metafunction must be supplied with
; the name of the function that is to be isolated.

; Matching through Defuns

; A psubst is said to be ``unfinished'' if there is some binding pair
; with fnp T in it.

; The Plan

; (0) Create an initial list of psubsts by unifying the initial pat
;     and term.  Call this list psubst-pool.
; (1) Pick an unfinished psubst from the pool.  If there are none, return
;     the pool.  Otherwise, let psubst be the chosen unfinished psubst,
;     with functional variable f.  By definition, f is a defined,
;     hereditarily constrained function symbol.
; (2) Convert psusbt to a mixed subst, subst, and recover the binding
;     of f, (lambda (v1...) term).  Note that the formals of the defined 
;     function f may be different from (v1 ...).
; (3) Is term a call of a defined function?  If not If not, delete
;     psubst from the psubst-pool and repeat from (1).  Else, term is
;     (g a1...) for some defined g.  Intuitively, the ai involve
;     the vi -- after all, (g a1 ...) is the body of a lambda with
;     local vars (v1...).  However, there may be free vars in the ai
;     and not every vi may be used.
; (4) Let f-formals be the formals of the lambda (not necessarily the
;     formals of f itself!).
; (5) Let f-body be the body of the defined function f, with the
;     formals of f replaced uniformly by f-formals.  Thus, it is now as
;     though f had been defined in the first place with the formals of the
;     lambda.
; (6) Standardize the f-formals away from the bound vars of the
;     psubst.  Call the new ones f-formals'.
; (7) Let f-body1 be the corresponding variant of f-body.  So now it
;     is thought f had been defined with formals, f-formals', that are
;     all free in the current psubst.
; (8) Let g-formals and g-body be the obvious things from the defun of g.
; (9) Instantiate g-body to get g-body1, replacing the formals of
;     g by the actuals, a1... -- after renaming the lambda formals (v1...)
;     used in the (a1...) according to the standardization adopted.
;(10) Compute the list of f-formals' that do not appear in the renamed
;     a'.  Bind them all to 'nil in the psubst and set the DONE
;     flag for the binding of f in that psubst.  Let the new psubst
;     be psubst1.
;(11) Use Huet-Lang to match f-body1 with g-body1, extending psubst.
;     Get back a list of extensions of psubst1.
;(12) Throw out of the extensions the variable bindings of the
;     f-formals'.  This produces extensions1.
;(13) Splice extensions1 into the pool in place of psubst.
;(14) Repeat from 1.

; The draconian restriction enforced by functional instantiation,
; concerning the avoidance of capture, means that some of the
; ``solutions'' found by hld-driver are not really solutions.  These
; non-solutions have to be filtered out.  We develop that filtering
; code below and then use it in the definition of the top-level hld.

; But let us explain.  Consider map-h and bumper1, as defined below.

; (defun map-h (x)
;  (if (endp x)
;       nil
;     (cons (h (car x)) (map-h (cdr x)))))

; (defun bumper1 (u v w)
;  (if (endp u)
;      nil
;    (cons (+ (* w (car u)) v)
;          (bumper1 (cdr u) v w))))

; where h is simply constrained.

; If you run

; (hld '(map-h x) '(bumper1 u v w) '(-1 . nil) nil nil 1 (w state))

; after modifying hld so as not to to filter out non-solutions, you
; get two solutions.  In the first, (H V1) is mapped to (+ (* W V1)
; V).  In the second, (H V1) is mapped to (+ (* W (CAR X)) V).  The
; second "solution" is not a solution!

; Here is the second "solution":

;  ((H . (LAMBDA (V1)
;                (BINARY-+ (BINARY-* W (CAR X)) V)))
;   (X . U)
;   (MAP-H . (LAMBDA (X) (BUMPER1 X V W))))

; In particular, its application to the defun of map-h fails to
; produce a theorem because it introduces a free X and is being
; applied to constraint, namely the defun of map-h, in which X
; appears.  The draconian restriction on functional substitution
; forces a renaming of that free X to, say, V2.  We then must prove
; the following functional instance of map-h, which is not a theorem:

; (EQUAL (BUMPER1 X V W)                         [lhs]
;        (AND (NOT (ENDP X))                     [rhs]
;             (CONS (+ (* W (CAR V2)) V)
;                   (BUMPER1 (CDR X) V W))))

; We renamed X to V2 because X was mentioned in the formula (the defun
; of map-h) being instantiated.  But suppose the formula had mentioned
; W instead (i.e., suppose the formal of map-h were W).  Then we would
; have renamed the free Ws to V2.  But W is among the free vars of
; MAP-H, and so it is ``appropriate'' for H to refer to it.  Put
; another way, we will end up with V2 in both [lhs] and [rhs].

; This actually raises its head in a worse way.  Can you instantiate

; (defun generic-run (s n)
;   (if (zp n)
;       s
;     (generic-run (h s) (- n 1))))

; to be

; (defun make-var-lst1 (root sym n acc)
;   (if (zp n)
;       acc
;     (make-var-lst1 root sym (1- n)
;                    (cons (intern-in-package-of-symbol
;                           (coerce

;                                    (explode-nonnegative-integer (1- n) nil))
;                            'string)
;                           sym)
;                          acc))))

; You may think you can instantiate h with
;  (lambda (s) 
;    (intern-in-package-of-symbol
;     (coerce
;      (append root
;              (explode-nonnegative-integer (1- n) nil))
;      'string)
;     sym))

; (which makes h ignore its argument s and instead introduce a free n)
; and this, indeed, seems to work until you discover the draconian restriction,
; which forces you to renames the free N, to say V1, to avoid capture.  

; Think of this as a programmer might: Can h be defined as a function
; so that generic-run does the same thing as make-var-lst1?  Answer:
; no.  h takes s as an argument and if it ignores s then h must be a
; constant function.  And any instantiation of generic-run with a
; constant h will produce a function that returns a monotonous list
; (of whatever constant h returns).  But make-var-lst1 is not
; monotonous.

; ACL2 Error in ...: Your functional substitution contains one or more
; free occurrences of the variable X in its range.  We enforce a
; draconian rule to avoid ``capturing'' such variables: if a
; substitution contains a free variable v in its range then we do not
; permit the substitution to be applied to any term that uses v as a
; variable symbol (whether freely or within a lambda or let
; binding). ... You must therefore change your functional substitution
; so that it stays clear of all the variables used in the target
; formula and the corresponding constraints.

; This function massages alist to permit its legal use.  Operationally,
; we compute four intermediate results:

; (a) avoid: the list of all variables used in any way in
;     thm, the constraints generated by applying alist, or bound
;     in alist; the last source of variables was sort of surprising:
;     suppose the alist contains (lambda (v1) (foo x v1)); then we
;     must rename x; but we cannot rename x to v1 or it will get
;     captured;
; (b) free: the list of all variables used freely in any 
;     lambda expression in alist;
; (c) renaming: an alist pairing each v in free with a new variable
;     u, not occurring in avoid; when possible we allow v to be 
;     "renamed" to itself, but this means our alist will have the
;     pair (v . v) in it;
; (d) unrenaming-substitution: this is like the inverse to renaming
;     except that instead of containing pairs (u . v) it contains
;     doublets (u v) as is required in the instantiation hint
;     that replaces the new u's by the originally requested v's,
;     (:instantiate ... (u v) ...); noop doublets like (u u) may
;     appear;
; (e) renamed-alist: the result of applying renaming to the given
;     functional substitution alist, replacing each FREE occurrence of v
;     by u; note that there may be bound occurrences of v, which we leave
;     untouched;

# make/DIRS

# This is the first file that gets processed by the path processing code.  If
# you ever want to override one of these, just add a DIRS file to your own
# local directory.

# All paths are relative to the location of the DIRS file.  When you process
# your own local DIRS file, the paths listed therein are relative to those
# files.

# When you want to add a new library, you should be able to just add an entry
# to this file and it will miraculously become available throughout all of the
# books that use the RAMS system.

# HOSTS File

# The hosts file is a simple list of hostnames of machines to use for your
# experiments.  This file is parsed in a very primitive way, so comments must
# begin on the very first character of the line, and cannot be on the same 
# line with hosts.


# Performance Considerations
#
# We probably shouldn't all use the same hosts file.  But, I'm not sure what a
# good scheme would be for assigning hosts to everyone, since we have "so few
# spare machines".
#
# If a host has more than one processor, you might consider listing it twice in
# order to take advantage of both processors.  However, I have not done this,
# since I fear that this might significantly slow down machines for other
# people.
#
# At the moment, tasks are assigned to CPUs in lockstep such that the first
# host listed will always try to certify the first file which is out of date,
# and so forth until each host has been assigned a task.  If there are still
# more files to certify, the hosts take them as they finish with their current
# tasks.  
#
# This is far from optimal -- nothing is done to try to balance our workload or
# otherwise apply intelligence to the job assignment.  Well, then, how *should*
# the load be balanced?  If we put the "big" jobs first, it would probably help
# to avoid idle time at the end where one processor still has a lot to do but
# the rest are finished.  On the other hand, if we put the "little" jobs first,
# we would very rapidly be able to give results for most of the build.  Also,
# it's horrible if we give a really big book to a weak machine, leaving the
# strong machines to idle.  I guess, if this is our problem, we are doing
# pretty well, so I will wait for another day to try to address it, and for now
# we will just use


# Avoid These Hosts
#
# I've noticed that the following machines seem to have problems running ACL2.
# (In fact, the executable just "hangs" and doesn't print anything at all).
# Also, I'm not sure if these are ok for us to use.  So, definitely don't add
# these unless you have figured out how to get ACL2 to run successfully, or it
# will look like these hosts are just taking a really long time on their files
# when actually they are doing no useful work.

# Potential Hosts?
#
# Here are some other machines that I can log onto, but I have no idea if these
# are ok for us to use or not.  So, I have kept them all commented out.  But,
# if you have some reason to belive that it is ok to use them, (maybe it's 8pm
# on a Sunday night), then by all means uncomment away.

# Good Hosts to Use
#
# Finally, here are the machines I feel pretty comfortable about using, and I'm
# pretty sure you'll be fine if you stick to these.  Of course, if we all start
# running Overkill sessions, we might really hose them.

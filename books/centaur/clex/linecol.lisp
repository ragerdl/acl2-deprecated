string."

  :long "<p>Keeping track of the line and column number is practically
important for producing good error messages.  The routines here are rather
specialized, and are mainly designed for use within our input stream
mechanism.</p>

<p>The normal convention used by, e.g., text editors like EMACS, is to show
line numbers starting at 1.  We adopt this convention in the interface to
our input streams.</p>

<p>However, <b>internally</b> we treat line numbers as starting at 0.  This
This has the good property that the line number never exceeds our current
character position in the file.  As a result, restricting ourselves to fixnum
positions automatically gives us fixnum line (and column) numbers.</p>")

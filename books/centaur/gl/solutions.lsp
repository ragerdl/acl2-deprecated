; This is a certifiable book, or would be if it were named .lisp.  For some
; time we called it solutions.lisp.  However, it frequently causes resource
; problems for certain Lisps, so we've renamed it to solutions.lsp so that
; it won't get automatically certified.

; To make this execute much faster, we'll want a higher memory ceiling.

; Added 8/24/13 by Matt K.: This book failed to certify because of a missing
; :ttags for the include-book form below.  However, the difference between
; using the two forms below, and not, was trivial when I used time$ to time the
; proof of 1f below:
;
;   ; including memory-mgmt:
;   36.39 seconds realtime, 36.29 seconds runtime
;   (3,472,888,144 bytes allocated).
;
;   ; NOT including memory-mgmt:
;   36.46 seconds realtime, 36.37 seconds runtime
;   (3,472,888,240 bytes allocated).
;
; (include-book "centaur/misc/memory-mgmt" :dir :system)
; (value-triple (set-max-mem (* 8 (expt 2 30))))

; Added by Matt K., 9/21/2013:

; With cmucl, one gets the following error for 1f (below) using a value here of
; 3000, even if -dynamic-space-size is set to 1632 on the command line, which
; is the maximum allowable in our CMUCL implementation, "CMU Common Lisp
; snapshot-2013-06 (20D Unicode)".
;   *A1 gc_alloc_large failed, nbytes=65244752.
;    CMUCL has run out of dynamic heap space (1632 MB).
;     You can control heap size with the -dynamic-space-size commandline option.
; So we use a smaller for limit CMUCL.  Note: Adding the two forms just above, to
; invoke set-max-mem, didn't solve the problem, whether I added them just above
; or added them at the beginning of this book.

; Added by Matt K., 11/3/2013: I killed an ACL2(h) certification run for this
; book using GCL 2.6.10pre that had already taken about 1 hour 36 minutes,
; which was using the first version of the next event.  So I tried
; certification using the second version of that event, but after 20 minutes
; working on that event, I killed that run, too.  So I'm avoiding the next form
; for GCL; but I will mention this to the GCL implementor.  Note that this book
; recently took less than 2 minutes to certify using ACL2(h) built on CCL, and
; for v6-3 took about 9 minutes using ACL2(h) built on CMUCL, which is normally
; a much slower lisp than GCL.

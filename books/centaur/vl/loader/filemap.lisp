  :long "<p>It is occasionally useful to gain direct access to the source text,
even before preprocessing has occurred.  Our file loading functions, such as
@(see vl-load), can optionally produce a <b>file map</b>, which is an alist
that associates each file name to its contents (represented as a string).</p>

<p>We previously represented the contents of each file as a list of @(see
extended-characters).  An advantage of extended characters was that file maps
were cheaper to construct because we already had the list of characters
available from our file-reading functions.  Using strings, we have to pay some
extra price for coercing the characters.</p>

<p>On the other hand, strings are more compact in memory and are generally
faster to serialize and load than extended characters.  When we began to
develop the @(see vl-server), these properties seemed quite attractive.</p>

<p>You might ask why we introduce file maps at all.  After all, a file map is
very similar to an alist that satisfies @(see vl-string-keys-p) and @(see
vl-string-values-p).  Our basic motivation is to make it more easy to change
the representation of a filemap in the future, should we decide that we need
either more control or flexibility in the underlying representation.</p>")

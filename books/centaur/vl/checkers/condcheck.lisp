  :short "Check for @('?:')-expressions with strange conditions."

  :long "<p>This is a heuristic for generating warnings.  We look for things
like the following, except that we target the @('?:') operator instead of
@('if') statements.</p>

@({
    if A { ... }
    else if B { ... }
    else if A { ... }   // already checked A above, so this is unreachable
    else if C { ... }
    else ...
})

<p>And also things like:</p>

@({
    if A { ... }
    else if B { ... }
    else if !A { ... }   // already checked A above, so this is just true
    else if C { ... }
    else ...
})

<p>And for @('if (constant) {...}').</p>

<p>All of this could be adapted to @('if') statements too, but we target the
@('?:') operator because we care a lot less about procedural code (like test
benches) than we do about the actual hardware modules.  Note that the @(see
qmarksize-check) can also be used for some additional checking on @('?:')
operators, but it tries to identify a different class of problems.</p>

<p>Since this is just a heuristic and it is completely unrelated to soundness,
we feel justified in doing a couple of seemingly unsound things.  In
particular, we basically ignore widths of test expressions and treat @('!')
and @('~') as equivalent.  We also treat @('^') as @('!=') and @('~^') as
@('==').  This is completely wrong in general, but it makes sense if you assume
that the tests are all going to be one-bit wide.</p>

<p>This check has no prerequisites and can in principle be run at any time.
But it is probably best to run it very early before throwing things out, and it
should probably be run before @(see oprewrite), which screws around with
conditional expressions, and also before things like expression splitting which
would get rid of the nested branches.</p>")

  :short "Canonicalize an test expression for condcheck."

  :long "<p>We fix X (in the normal sense of @(see vl-expr-strip), to throw away
widths, attributes, etc., to facilitate equality checking), and then do certain
kinds of not-necessarily-sound rewriting to try to further canonicalize things.
These rewrites might possibly help us recognize a broader class of errors, but
probably aren't super important.</p>

@({
    !A     --> ~A               unsound, but sort of valid for one-bit ops

    A != B --> ~(A == B)        and we sort the args
    A ~^ B --> A == B           unsound, but sort of valid for one-bit ops
    A ^ B  --> ~(A == B)        unsound, but sort of valid for one-bit ops

    A < B  --> ~(A >= B)
    A > B  --> ~(B >= A)
    A <= B --> B >= A
})

<p>We also put arguments of commutative operators into @(see <<) order.  Note
that we only apply these rewrites at the top-level and not in any deep way,
which also sort of makes sense since we only want to assume that the top-level
expression is one-bit wide.</p>"

<p>We think it would be strange to see an expression like @('A ? B : C') where
@('A') is not one bit wide.  It found a few minor things that we were able to
clean up, but nothing that was really a bug.</p>

<p>Since the @('?:') operator has the lowest precedence, expressions like @('A
& B ? C : D') are parsed as @('(A & B) ? C : D'), which might not be what is
intended.  In some cases, an actual precedence problem might be revealed by
seeing that the size of the test expression isn't 1.</p>")

exprsesion @('x') which should be the @('test') expression from a conditional
expression like:</p>

@({
    test ? then : else
})

<p>Also, @('x') should have already been sized.</p>

<p>Since @(see oprewrite) is applied before sizing, @('x') has been transformed
and either looks like @('|A') or @('~(|A)'), where @('A') is the original
version of @('x').</p>

<p>We want to return the width of @('A'), rather than the width of
@('x') (which is always just 1), so that we can detect cases where the test
expression that was given was wider than 1 bit.</p>

<p>To support this, @(see oprewrite) is set up so that it annotates the @('|')
and @('~') expressions it introduces with the @('VL_CONDITIONAL_FIX')
attribute.  We check for this attribute in order to know where to find
@('A').</p>"

  :long "<p>We say expressions are well-typed when their signs and widths have
been computed, and when certain consistency requirements are met.  This is a
rather elaborate consistency check we use as a basic correctness property of
our @(see expression-sizing) transformation.  It may also be useful in later
transformations to insist that the you are working with reasonably sane
expressions.</p>

<p>Every atom in the expression must satisfy @(see vl-atom-welltyped-p).</p>

<p>Every nonatom has certain consistency checks that depend upon which operator
is being applied.  For instance, in an expression like @('a + b'), we require
that the final width/type of the expression agrees exactly with the final
widths/types of @('a') and @('b').  As another example, we insist that the
finalwidth/type of @('&foo') is one-bit unsigned, but otherwise we only require
that the width of @('foo') itself is non-zero.</p>")

 :long "<p>For every integer <see topic=\"@(url
vl-atom-p)\">atom</see> (whether constant or weird), the finalwidth and
finaltype must agree with the origwidth and origtype of the guts.</p>

<p>For every identifier atom, the finalwidth and finaltype <b>may differ</b>
from the identifier's declaration.  These differences allow us to implicitly
represent the sign-extension or zero-extension of a wire, register, or
variable.  Informally, we also generally expect that the finalwidth should
never be less than the declaration's width, and that the finaltype should be
signed only if the declaration is signed.  But to allow @(see
vl-expr-welltyped-p) not to take a module as an argument, we actually do not
check that these expectations hold.</p>

<p>For string atoms, per Section 3.6 we say that the finalwidth must be 8 times
the string's length (which, interestingly, may be zero).  We also say that the
finaltype is unsigned.</p>

<p>For all other atoms, we insist that the finaltype and finalwidth are
@('nil'), which we intend to mean \"not applicable\".  These atoms are reals,
function names and system function names, and the individual pieces of
hierarchical identifiers.</p>"

  :short "The error handling strategy used by @(see vl-simplify)."

  :long "<p>As described in @(see warnings), our @(see transforms) can
sometimes run into severe problems, e.g., we might run into an instance of an
undefined module.  In this case, the transform should typically extend the
module with a fatal warning.</p>

<p>In the context of @(see vl-simplify), we generally want to throw away any
design elements (e.g., modules, packages, etc.) that have fatal errors, so that
we only produce a formal model of whatever part of the design is well-formed
and supported.</p>

<p>For various reasons, it's a good idea to throw away any these bad parts of
the design as early as possible.  The main reason for this is that it easier to
identify the root cause of the problem.  Problems tend to snowball.  It's much
better to see a single fatal error from the first transform that hit a problem
than to see dozens errors from different transforms that all have the same
underlying cause.  Throwing out modules early also helps to improve performance
by cutting down the design; there's no point in further transforming stuff
we're going to throw away, anyway.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we can't really just throw bad parts of the design away.
We at least need some way to see what went wrong, so that we can debug it.</p>

<p>Our basic strategy for dealing with this, in @(see vl-simplify) at least, is
to imagine two designs, <b>good</b> and <b>bad</b>.  Initially, we put all of
the design elements into the good design, and the bad design is empty.  We
always only try to transform the good design, and afterward we can move any
design elements that had errors into the bad design.</p>

<p>Moving things into the bad design is tricky because design elements do not
exist in isolation.  When, for instance, some module M has an error, we would
ideally like to remove not only M but also all modules that transitively depend
on M.  Moreover, we also want to make sure that any modules that are killed off
in this transitive way get extended with some kind of warning that explains why
the module is being removed.</p>

<p>Because this is so complicated, we bundle up the process into a function,
@(see vl-design-propagate-errors), which is intended to move any design
elements that (transitively) have errors from @('good') to @('bad').</p>")

  :long "<h3>Explanation of Blame Alists</h3>

<p>Suppose we are transforming a list of modules, and we run into problems in
some module, @('M').  Our basic strategy for @(see propagating-errors) is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a warning onto @('M') that says why we had the problem, and</li>
<li>Remove @('M') from the list of modules, so that we can continue with the
other modules.</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn't really good enough.  Besides removing @('M'), we should also
remove any dependents (@(see vl-dependent-modules)) of @('M'), since removing
@('M') would cause these modules to be incomplete.  As we remove these
dependent modules, we would also like to annotate them with warnings explaining
that they are being removed because of problems with @('M').</p>

<p>In general, instead of a single \"bad\" module, imagine that we have a list
of bad modules, @('B1'), ..., @('Bn').  Additionally,</p>

<ul>
<li>Let @('deps(Bi)') be the set of all modules that (transitively) depend on
@('Bi').</li>
<li>Let @('D') be the union over @('deps(Bi)'), i.e., @('D') is the set of all
modules that depend on any bad module)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that there is no generally reason to think that @('deps(Bi)') is
disjoint from @('deps(Bj)').  If a module @('M') instantiates both @('Bi') and
@('Bj'), then it will be in the dependents for both of them.  So, which one
should be blamed?</p>

<p>Our approach is to blame them both..  To do this, we first construct a
<b>blame alist</b>.  This alist includes an entry for every module @('M') in
@('D').  In particular, we associate each such @('M') with @('{ Bi
: M in deps(Bi) }').  Once the blame alist is constructed, we can easily use
it to annotate each module in its domain with a warning that says which modules
are to blame for its removal.</p>")

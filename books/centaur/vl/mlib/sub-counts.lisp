  :short "A mechanism for transitively counting the number of submodule
instances beneath a module."

  :long "<p>The basic idea is that we want to be able to build a report that
says how many times each kind of module occurs.  Some possible uses include
counting up how many registers are within a certain module, etc.</p>

<p>This seems easy, but there are some subtle things to consider.</p>

<p>For one, there may be good reasons to want to count before or after certain
transforms.  For instance:</p>

<ul>

<li>You might want to count before @(see occform) so that you don't see modules
like @('VL_3_BIT_AND'), or maybe you want to count after occforming because
these numbers are interesting.</li>

<li>You might want to count before @(see unparameterization) because you don't
want to see things like basic_reg$width=5, or maybe you want to count after
unparameterization because these are exactly the stats you want.</li>

</ul>

<p>We try to be flexible and do something sensible no matter what kind of
modules we are given as inputs.  But that makes things a little tricky.  It is
especially tricky to handle modules that still have parameters and that
instantiate arrays of modules using those parameters.</p>

<p>Because of this flexibility, we expect that in certain cases we could run
into problems.  What should we do if we run into an instance of a module that
doesn't exist?  What should we do if we run into an array of instances and we
can't tell how wide it is?</p>

<p>Well, my general feeling is that getting a partial count is more useful than
getting no count at all.  So, in these hard cases I'm willing to fudge the
answer and undercount.</p>")

(defsection subcount-handling-parameters
  :short "Notes about how we handle modules with parameters."
  :long "<p>There are a couple of things to note.  Of course, a module can have
its own parameters and instances can give values to some of these.  Take for
instance:</p>

@({
   module sub (...) ;
     parameter size = 1;
     ...
      sub2 #(size + 1) foo (...);
      sub3 foo [size-1:0] bar (...);
   endmodule

   module main (...);
     parameter delay = 1;
     parameter mode = 3;
     ...
     sub #(7) baz (...);
   endmodule
})

<p>Our top-level submodule counting procedure is @('(vl-subcount-mod mod
sigma)'). This omits certain other constant arguments like the modalist.</p>

<p>The SIGMA it takes should give the values for some of the parameters of MOD.
We make sure the SIGMA is honsed so memoization can hit for two different
module instances that use the same parameters.</p>

<p>We explicitly do NOT require that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The SIGMA is complete and gives a value for every parameter, or</li>
<li>The SIGMA contains only resolved expressions for values</li>
</ul>

<p>But we do assume that the SIGMA only binds module parameters.  For instance,
we should not see \"delay\" in the SIGMA for SUB, because SUB doesn't have a
parameter named delay and it might have other wires named delay, etc.</p>

<p>In ordinary @(see unparameterization), we would use the sigma to rewrite the
module.  But that's considerably overkill for what we're trying to do here: The
only things we really care about are module instance parameter lists and
ranges.</p>

<p>The function @('(vl-subcount-modinsts modinsts sigma)') is a trivial wrapper
that just iterates over the module instances, calling at each step the main
function @('(vl-subcount-modinst modinst sigma)').</p>

<p>Here there are a couple of things to do.</p>

<ol>

<li>We rewrite the parameters and range of modinst (if any) with the current
    sigma. For instance, if we were processing the modinsts of \"sub\" above,
    using a sigma where size=7, then as a first step we'd rewrite foo and bar
    to:
    @({
         sub2 #(6) foo (...);
         sub3 bar [6:0] (...);
    })
    This simplification is done by just substituting in the sigma and
    then rewrititing with @(see vl-rangeexpr-reduce).</li>

<li>We then try to construct a new sigma to use for the submodule, e.g.,
    we would bind foo's parameter to 6; but bar has no parameters so its
    sigma is just NIL.</li>

<li>We then recursively process the submodule under the new sigma.</li>

</ol>

<p>If the arguments or range don't become resolved, that's fine: we just use an
empty sigma, so uses of the affected parameters are just left alone, and we
fudge things all the way down.</p>")


(define vl-merge-subcounts
  :short "The main function for merging together the results we've collected."

  :long "<p>Suppose we're marching along and counting up submodule occurrences.
ANS is the answer we have so far, derived from the module instances we've
already processed so far.</p>

<p>Now suppose we've just run into an instance like this:</p>

@({
    foo #(3, 5) my_foo [7:0] (...)
})

<p>We assume we've already counted up all of the submodule instances within
module FOO under the parameter list #(3, 5).  We assume that SUB is the counts
alist we've obtained from FOO under this parameter list.  We assume that SUB
has already been shrunk, so we can recur over it without hitting shadowed
pairs!</p>

<p>The basic goal is to extend ANS with the information we've just learned from
SUB.  This is basically straightforward: for each count entry in SUB, we look
up the corresponding entry in ANS and increment its count by the right
amount.</p>

<p>The COUNT argument lets us efficiently account for instance ranges.  For
instance, in my_foo above, COUNT would be 8.  Suppose that according to SUB,
there are 3 occurrences of MYREG inside of FOO.  Then we really want to do
something like ANS[MYREG].COUNT += 24 instead of ANS[MYREG].COUNT += 3.</p>

<p>The WARNINGS argument lets us mark any entries that have been affected by
fudging.  Basically, we'll set ANS[mod].WARNINGS @= WARNINGS for all modules in
SUB.</p>"

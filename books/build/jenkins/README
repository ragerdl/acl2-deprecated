ACL2 Books Jenkins Build Scripts
Original author: Jared Davis <jared@centtech.com>

Jenkins is a popular tool for implementing continuous integration servers.  Its
homepage is here:

     http://jenkins-ci.org/

This directory contains build scripts for use with Jenkins.  The general idea
is to allow Jenkins to watch for new commits, and then automatically build ACL2
and the books (using "make all") on several Lisp platforms and ACL2 variants:

       ACL2() on CCL           } with quicklisp
       ACL2(h) on CCL          }
       ACL2(r) on CCL          }
       ACL2(h) on SBCL         }

       ACL2(h) on GCL-ANSI     } without quicklisp
       ACL2() on GCL-CLTL1     }

Jenkins has a nice interface that lets you see the progress of these jobs, and
it generally takes care of mundane issues like:

    - updating your copy of the sources, using either
         * full builds from a fresh checkout, or
         * "svn update" to minimize rebuilding
    - preventing multiple builds from interfering with one another
    - preventing machines from getting overloaded
    - noticing that a job seems to be running forever
    - keeping recent logs so you can review them later
    - (optional) emails/irc notifications whenever things fail

To make it possible to use these scripts in other environments, I've written
each script to start with:

   source $JENKINS_HOME/env.sh

So you should be able ot easily set up a suitable env.sh that configures your
PATH and so forth.

Please contact Jared with any questions or feedback.

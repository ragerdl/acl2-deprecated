  "<p>When @(see local) @(tsee include-book) forms are used in support of
  definitions and theorems, the resulting book or @(tsee encapsulate) event may
  be ill-formed because of missing definitions.  The macro,
  @('with-supporters'), is intended to avoid this problem.  See also @(tsee
  with-supporters-after) for a related utility.</p>

  <p>General forms:</p>

  @({
  (with-supporters local-event event-1 ... event-k)
  })

  @({
  (with-supporters local-event
                   :names (name-1 ... name-m)
                   event-1 ... event-k)
  })

  <p>where @('local-event') and each event @('event-i') and (if supplied)
  @('name-i') are @(see events) and @('local-event') is @(see local).  The
  effect is the same as</p>

  @({((encapsulate () local-event EXTRA event-1 ... event-k)})

  <p>where @('EXTRA') is a sequence of events that includes the following, in
  an attempt to re-create the environment produced by @('local-event') in order
  to process each @('event-i') during the second pass of the @(tsee
  encapsulate) event.</p>

  <ul>

  <li>function definitions</li>

  <li>definitions of macros that are aliases for additional functions being
  defined; see @(see macro-aliases-table)</li>

  <li>@(tsee in-theory) events so that the rules introduced by the @('EXTRA')
  definitions are suitably enable or disabled</li>

  <li>If @(':names') is supplied, then the first events in @('EXTRA') are the
  events named by the @('name-i'), in order.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>We now illustrate with examples, starting with one that does not use the
  @(':names') keyword.</p>

  <p>Consider the following event.</p>

  @({
  (encapsulate
   ()
   (local (include-book \"std/lists/duplicity\" :dir :system))
   (defthm duplicity-append
     (equal (duplicity a (append x y))
            (+ (duplicity a x) (duplicity a y)))))
  })

  <p>This event fails because the function @('duplicity') is defined in the
  locally included book, and hence that function is undefined when the above
  @(tsee defthm) form is processed during the second pass of the @(tsee
  encapsulate) event.  (Recall that @(see local) events are skipped during that
  pass; see @(see encapsulate).)</p>

  <p>One solution is to move the @('include-book') form so that it appears
  non-locally in front of the @('encapsulate') event.  But we may not want to
  include other @(see events) from that book, out of concern that rules defined
  in that book could affect our proof development.</p>

  <p>A more suitable solution may thus be to use the macro,
  @('with-supporters'), in place of @('encapsulate'), as follows.</p>

  @({
  (with-supporters
   (local (include-book \"std/lists/duplicity\" :dir :system))
   (defthm duplicity-append
     (equal (duplicity a (append x y))
            (+ (duplicity a x) (duplicity a y)))))
  })

  <p>That macro determines automatically that the function @('duplicity') needs
  to be defined, so it generates an @('encapsulate') event like the original
  one above but with the definition of @('duplicity') added non-locally.  In
  this example, @('duplicity') is actually defined in terms of another
  function, @('duplicity-exec'), so its definition is needed as well.  The
  generated event is initially as follows.</p>

  @({
  (encapsulate
   ()
   (local (include-book \"std/lists/duplicity\"
                        :dir :system))
   (std::defredundant
     :names (duplicity-exec duplicity))
   (defthm duplicity-append
     (equal (duplicity a (append x y))
            (+ (duplicity a x) (duplicity a y)))))
  })

  <p>Notice that @('with-supporters') is implemented using the macro @(tsee
  std::defredundant).  (Also see @(see redundant-events).)  When the call above
  of @('std::defredundant') is expanded, the result is essentially as follows.
  Note that @(tsee in-theory) events are generated in an attempt to set the
  enable/disable status of each rule introduced by each function to match the
  status after the original @('include-book') event.</p>

  })

  <p>For a second example, consider the following form from the @(see
  community-books), file @('tools/with-supporters-test-top.lisp').</p>

  @({
  (with-supporters
   (local (include-book \"with-supporters-test-sub\"))
   :names (mac1 mac1-fn)
   (defun h2 (x)
     (g3 x)))
  })

  <p>Here are the events in the locally included book.</p>

  @({
  (defun mac1-fn (x)
    x)

  (defmacro mac1 (x)
    (mac1-fn x))

  (defun g1 (x)
    (declare (xargs :guard t))
    (mac1 x))

  (defun mac2-fn-b (x)
    x)

  (defun mac2-fn (x)
    (mac2-fn-b x))

  (defmacro mac2 (x)
    (mac2-fn x))

  (add-macro-alias mac2 g2)

  (defun g2 (x)
    (declare (xargs :guard (g1 x)))
    (mac2 x))

  (defun g3 (x)
    (g2 x))
  })

  <p>Notice that @('g3') in the top-level book calls @('g2'), whose @(see
  guard) mentions @('g1').  Now although @('g1') calls the macro @('mac1'),
  @('with-supporters') is not clever enough to notice this, because it tracks
  dependencies using translated terms (see @(see term)), for which macros have
  been expanded away.  Thus, macros like @('mac1'), as well as functions used
  in their definitions (like @('mac1-fn')), must be specified explicitly.
  This specification is made with @(':names (mac1 mac1-fn)') in the call of
  @('with-supporters') above.</p>

  <p>There is an exception to this required use of the @(':names') keyword
  argument: macros that are aliases for functions that support the events.
  Returning to our example, notice that @('g3') is defined using the function
  @('g2'), which in turn calls the macro, @('mac2').  So we might expect, as
  described for @('mac1') above, that @('mac2') must be included in
  @(':names').  But fortunately, @('mac2') is a macro alias for a function that
  supports the definition of @('h2') specified in the call of
  @('with-supporters'): @('g2') supports that definition and @('mac2') is a
  macro alias for @('g2').  Thus @('mac2') and its supporting function
  @('mac2-fn') are added to the list of generated events (called @('EXTRA'),
  above).</p>

  <p>In summary, the above call of @('with-supporters') generates the following
  event.</p>

  @({
  (ENCAPSULATE NIL
                (LOCAL (INCLUDE-BOOK \"with-supporters-test-sub\"))
                (DEFUN MAC1-FN (X) X)
                (DEFMACRO MAC1 (X) (MAC1-FN X))
                (STD::DEFREDUNDANT G1 MAC2-FN-B MAC2-FN MAC2 G2 G3)
                (DEFUN H2 (X) (G3 X)))
  })

  <p>As in the first example, @('std::defredundant') generates definitions for
  the indicated names.</p>")

  :short "Automatically define necessary redundant definitions from after a

  "<p>When @(see local) @(tsee include-book) forms are used in support of
  definitions and theorems, the resulting book or @(tsee encapsulate) event may
  be ill-formed because of missing definitions.  The macro,
  @('with-supporters-after'), is intended to avoid this problem.</p>

  <p>See @(tsee with-supporters) for a related utility.  (However,
  @('with-supporters-after') does not support the @(':names') argument; that
  should be straightforward to add, if needed.)  The documentation below
  assumes familiarity with @('with-supporters').</p>

  <p>General form:</p>

  @({(with-supporters-after name event-1 ... event-k)})

  <p>where @('name') is the name of an event and @('event-i') are @(see
  events).  The effect is the same as</p>

  @({((encapsulate () EXTRA event-1 ... event-k)})

  <p>where @('EXTRA') includes redundant definitions of functions introduced
  after @('name'), as necessary, in order to avoid undefined function errors
  when processing this @(tsee encapsulate) event.  (As with
  @('with-supporters), @('EXTRA') may also include macro aliases and their
  supporters; see @(see with-supporters) for details.)  @('EXTRA') also
  includes @(see in-theory) events so that the rules introduced by the
  @('EXTRA') definitions are suitably enable or disabled.  Consider the
  following example.</p>

  @({
  (in-package \"ACL2\")

  (include-book \"tools/with-supporters\" :dir :system)

  (deflabel my-label)

  (local (include-book \"std/lists/duplicity\" :dir :system))

  (with-supporters-after
   my-label
   (defthm duplicity-append
     (equal (duplicity a (append x y))
            (+ (duplicity a x) (duplicity a y)))))
  })

  <p>The form above is equivalent to the following.  Again, see @(tsee
  with-supporters) for relevant background.  Note that the present macro, like
  that one, is also implemented using the macro @(tsee std::defredundant).</p>

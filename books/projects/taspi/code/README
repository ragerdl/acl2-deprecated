directory: taspi/code

Contains underlying code for the TASPI system, most notably, functions for
generating fringes from a tree term, and for generating a newick-like tree
from a set of fringes.

Books are built using the hons system, with some arithmetic.

Basic structure for each book:
	xxx-helper : functions and thms for guards and measures
	xxx : guts of the book
	xxx-guards : guard verification thms and properties

Books: sets bdd-functions fast-lists
       replete-helper replete replete-guards	
       fringes-helper fringes fringes-guards
       build-term-helper build-term build-term-guards

To include everything from this directory:
(include-book "build-term-guards")

To only include function definitions (little proof):
(include-book "build-term")

This book is a part of a two-book series to develop a generic theory that
allows us to compose partial correctness proofs efficiently.  Here I briefly
discuss the problem and the solution.

  [Uninteresting aside: I use mathematical notations rather than Lisp in the
   description below as much as possible since emacs gets confused about syntax
   highlighting if I use s-expressions in a comment that is delineated by a
   "block comment" rather than a "line comment".]

The Problem (and some Background)
---------------------------------

Recall that a partial correctness proof looks like the following: 

o   pre(s) /\ exists-exitpoint (s) => run(s,clock(s)) = modify(s)

Assume that we have proven this theorem about a subroutine Q, and we now are
interested in proving the correctness of some caller P of Q.  While verifying P
we want to of course not re-verify Q but reuse the work in its verification by
making use of the correctness theorem above.  More concretely, consider using
the cutpoint methodology (and the inductive assertions method) to prove the
correctness of P.  The crucial step in the method is to prove the following
theorem:


o  cut(s) /\ assert(s) /\ exists-cut (s) => assert(nextc(next(s)))

In defsimulate this was proven by just symbolically simulating the machine from
each cutpoint until the next cutpoint is reached.  But the process might cause
repeated symbolic simulation of an already verified subroutine Q.  We prefer
instead to invoke the correctness theorem of Q when symbolic simulation
encounters an invocation of Q.  That is, consider symbolically simulating the
machine starting from a cutpoint s of P.  When we encounter a state s'
involving an invocation of Q, we want to then look for the next cutpoint of s
from the state modify s.

It would have been nice if we could have proven a theorem of the form pre-Q(s)
=> nextc-p(s) = nextc-p(modify(s)).  Unfortunately, given the definition of
nextc (in partial-correctness.lisp and total-correctness.lisp) and the
correctness of Q above, this is not a theorem when Q is proven partially
correct.  The theorem is something like: 

o  pre-Q(s) /\ exists-exitpoint-Q (s) => nextc-p (s) = nextc-p (modify (s))  

But now we get into trouble.  We want to do the symbolic simulation in order to
prove the persistence of assertions over cutpoints.  In that context we know
exists-cut (s) for each cutpoint s of P (from the hypothesis of the theorem we
want to prove).  This hypothesis, together with some hypothesis of the
well-formedness of the subroutine Q, will be sufficient to derive
exists-exitpoint-Q (s) and hence apply the subroutine correctness theorem
above.  But we do not know exists-cut (s) for the state s that is poised at the
invocation of Q.  Rather, we know it only at the previous cutpoint before the
invocation.  Of course by "construction" we know that (a) the hypothesis was
there for a previous state, and (b) no cutpoint was encountered from that
previous state to the invocation point; therefore the hypothesis must be true
for the invocation point.  But to apply this argument we need either some
memoizing term simplifier that memoizes each of the intermediate symbolic
states (and the fact that exists-cutpoint holds for each of those), which of
course, ACL2 is not, or we must symbolically simulate the machine twice, once
for actually proving the inductive assertions and the other for advancing the
exists-cutpoint predicate, the second being a completely unnecessary one).  In
a previous version of these books, I had managed to get rid of the double
simulation by creating a number of cludges involving the use of hide.  But such
optimizations are purely ACL2-specific and no more than "dirty hacks".  The
challenge therefore is to solve the problem in a clean way.

;; [ Maybe it is worth thinking whether we want to just use the above definition
;;   of epc-next-cutpoints for proving partial correctness theorem in the generic
;;   theory.  The reason why I do not do that is because the above definition only
;;   works for partial correctness, not total correctness.  Why?  Because for
;;   total correctness we need to know that the epc-next-cutpoint is a reachable
;;   state, and we do not have the extra hypothesis that some cutpoint is
;;   reachable.  But suppose no cutpoint is actually reachable from state s.  The
;;   above definition of epc-next-cutpoint may still produce a cutpoint (the
;;   definition is tail-recursive and we do not know what the definition produces
;;   when no cutpoint is reachable) and the cutpoint-measure of that cutpoint
;;   might even decrease, but that does not guarantee total correctness (since no
;;   cutpoint is reachable from a state, and hence no exitpoint).  And I just
;;   preferred to have the same "golden" definition of epc-next-cutpoint rather than
;;   two different ones.  So I just use this definition as a proof rule in order
;;   to compositionally prove partial correctness or more precisely, the original

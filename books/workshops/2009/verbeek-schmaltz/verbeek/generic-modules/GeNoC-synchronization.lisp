  (;;req_tans is the equivalent of requesting a transmission in a
   ;;synchronisation protocol, it takes whatever action is suuposed to
   ;;be taken to initialise a communication
   ((req_trans *) => *)
   ;;next function is the function that checks if we can put the
   ;;acknowledge to 1 or not really
   ((process_req * * ) => *)
   ;; this function checks if it's possible to do the transmission and
   ;; if so, it takes the action in case of the possibility of a communication
   ((chk_avail * * * *) => *)
   ;; the next function uses chk_avail to see if it's possible to do a
   ;; transmission it send back the st updated with the required
   ;; action or leaves it as it is 
   ;; the check to decide wether the transmission will be done or not
   ;; will be done in the scheduling function by looking at the state
   ;; after the action has been taken by the next function
   ;; the usage of the state only to make the decision is attractive
   ;; however it means we imply the presence of a certain entry to
   ;; change, thus we prefer two values as the  result 
   ;; the result of the test + the updated state, in this case the
   ;; user can use the result of the test and not the state
   ((good_route? * * * * ) => (mv * *))
   ;; a cover fucntion used from the scheduling instance that calls
   ;; the previous function
   ((test_routes * *) => (mv * *))
   ;;a test function that will be used by the scheduling in the
   ;;actual check to verify the condition for a communication
   ;;and it sends back a true or nil
   ((check_ack * * *) => *))

The files shown below, distributed with ACL2(r) in directory
books/nonstd/nsa/, constitute the supporting materials for the ACL2
2009 Workshop paper "Inverse Functions in ACL2(r)" by Ruben Gamboa and
John R. Cowles.

Because these files are distributed with ACL2(r), and do not work with
ACL2 (without the "(r)"), they are not duplicated here.  Below is the
data from a Readme.lsp that could be included with this contribution.

(:ABSTRACT 
 "ACL2(r) supports the definition of real-valued functions.  In this paper, 
  we introduce a theory of inverse functions into ACL2(r).  The theory is 
  developed in stages, from an abstract description of inverse functions, 
  to a still abstract but more tractable treatment of the inverse of 
  continuous functions.  A macro is introduced to simplify the introduction 
  of concrete inverse functions.  We illustrate the approach by defining some 
  inverse functions in ACL2, including the square root, natural logarithm, 
  inverse sine, and inverse cosine functions.")

XDOC is a tool for documenting ACL2 books, and is intended as a
replacement for ACL2 facilities like defdoc, :doc, etc.

XDOC can create manuals like this:

If you just want to see documentation for ACL2 and its books, the
above link may be all you need.

You might prefer a local copy of the documentation, e.g., for offline
use.  If you have already built the ACL2 books, you should already
have a local copy here:

    acl2-sources/books/centaur/manual/preview.html.

Additional information about XDOC itself can be found here:

    http://fv.centtech.com/acl2/latest/doc/frames2.html?topic=ACL2____XDOC

This documentation explains how to use XDOC to document your own
books, generate extended manuals (e.g., that cover your proprietary
books in addition to the ordinary ACL2 books), and so forth.

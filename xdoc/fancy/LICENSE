   and licensing of the Viewer Files, only.

   The topics in Content Files, such as xindex.js, xdata.js, and (in some
   cases) xdata.db, are usually derived from ACL2 books and/or other source
   code files.  These topics are typically subject to their own copyright and
   licensing terms, which are beyond the scope of this LICENSE.

  :long "<p>@(call ichar<) determines if @('x') is \"smaller\" than @('y'), but
ignoring case.  Our approach is basically to downcase upper-case letters and
then compare the resulting character codes.</p>

<p>Something subtle about this is that, in the ASCII character ordering, the
upper-case characters do not immediately preceede the lower-case ones.  That
is, upper-case Z is at 90, but lower-case a does not start until 97.  So, in
our approach, the 6 intervening characters (the square brackets, backslash,
hat, underscore, and backtick) are considered \"smaller\" than letters, even
though in regular ASCII ordering they are \"larger\" than the upper-case
letters.</p>"

;; Computing Pick a Point Hints
;;
;; Now, what we are going to do next is create a computed hint that will look
;; for instances of a trigger, and if it sees one, we will try to provide a
;; functional instantiation hint.  Our computed hint function is called as ACL2
;; is working to simplify terms, and it is allowed to examine the current
;; clause.  
;;
;; Terminology: A clause is a list of disjuncts, e.g.,
;;
;;   (a ^ b ^ ...) => P  is  (~a v ~b v ... v P)
;;   (a v b v ...) => P  is  subgoal1: (~a v P), sg2: (~b v P), ...
;;
;; The disjuncts are each terms, e.g., (foo x y).
;;
;; Our first step is to see if our hint should even be applied to this clause.
;; We should only give a hint if we see one of our triggers (i.e., if a hint
;; tagging rule has fired).
;;
;; We check for the existence of our triggers using the following function,
;; (pick-a-point-trigger-harvester clause rules acc-lit acc-rule).
;;
;;   Clause is the current clause we are processing.
;;   Rules is the database of pick a point rules (a btree).
;;   Acc-lit is an accumulator that stores the matching clauses.
;;   Acc-rule is an accumulator that stores the matching rules.
;;
;; We look for known triggers and if we find any, we add the literal to the
;; acc-lit accumulator, and we add the corresponding rule to the acc-rule
;; accumulator.  Hence, the nth element of each accumulator corresponds to the
;; nth element of the other.  We return both accumulators.

;; our trigger term, so we remove it from the clause leaving us with ((not a)
;; (not b) ...).  What we need to do is recover the original hypotheses, namely
;; (a ^ b ^ ...).  To do this, we will negate each literal and then and them
;; together, which will create the the term (and a b ...), which was our

; Slight modification by Matt Kaufmann for ACL2 Version 3.3:
;   "Fixed a bug in handling of computed hints related to the
;    stable-under-simplificationp parameter (see *note COMPUTED-HINTS::)."
; The bug in Versions 3.2 and before was that a computed hint firing when
; stable-under-simplificationp took us back to the preprocess ledge of the
; waterfall, where :use hints aren't applied.  So the original combination of
; :use and :expand generated by the following function caused only the
; application of the :expand hint; the :use hint was left alone and then
; applied to the next subgoal.  With the fix, we can create that same behavior
; by judicious use of the :computed-hint-replacement feature, so that the
; :expand hint continues to be applied first.

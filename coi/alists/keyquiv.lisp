;; Interpreting Objects as Conses (consfix)
;; 
;; We can think of a mapping between all ACL2 objects and conses, so that any
;; atom is mapped to (nil . nil) and any cons is mapped to itself.  The
;; function consfix applies this mapping for us, i.e., it interprets any ACL2
;; object as a cons.  Because this is how car and cdr interpret their
;; arguments, there are some very nice properties that we can prove about this
;; operation.

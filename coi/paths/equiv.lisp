;;
;; The new direction for path reasoning.
;;
;; We define a very strong notion of sets of paths that allows us to fix a set
;; to the most dominant members.  It also has the nice set properties of
;; ignoring duplicates and sorting elements.
;;
;; I think this notion will play well with such operations as (cp-set set st1
;; st2) in which dominating paths take precidence.  Hopefully it will work
;; well with dtrees/gwv as well.

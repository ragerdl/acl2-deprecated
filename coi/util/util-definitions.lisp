  o First, implement the exising rule set infrastructure with this as
an underpinning.

  o Add additional versioning capabilities as permitted.

;; Associated with each version are:
;; - the classes to disable
;; - the classes to enable
;; - the rules to disable
;; - the rules to enable

;; - may not redefine (change) a version extension.
;; - must be defined in terms of an existing version.
;; - by default, a version extends nil (the initial version)

#
#				  make/DIRS
#
# This is the first file that gets processed by the path processing code.  It
# is used to set up keyword-to-directory links in the form:
#
#   :keyword = relative_directory_path
#
# These settings support the ACL2 events:
#
#   (include-book "foo" :dir :keyword)
#
# When you want to add a new library, you should be able to just add an entry
# to this file and it will miraculously become available throughout all of the
# books that use the RAMS system.
#
#			     Overriding Settings
#
# If you ever want to override one of the settings in this master DIRS file,
# just add a DIRS file to your own local directory with the new setting it in.
#
# RAMS overrides single settings, not the whole DIRS file.  Any settings in
# your local ./DIRS file take precedence over the ones here.  Any settings
# here that are not overridden stay in force.
#
#
#			   Relative Directory Paths
#
# Normally, all the directory paths are relative to the location of the DIRS
# file.  When you process your own local ./DIRS file, the paths listed therein
# are relative to those files.
#
#			  Interactions with LIB_ROOT
#
# You may be using different libraries from the ones that come with MAKEDIR.
# In that case, you will have specified a value for LIB_ROOT such that
# $(LIB_ROOT)/make is not equal to $(MAKEDIR).  Relative paths are then
# reinterpreted as follows:
#
#   Top-Level DIRS file
#
#     The paths here in the master DIRS file are taken to be relative to
#     $(LIB_ROOT)/make.
#
#  Local DIRS files
#
#     The relative paths in your local ./DIRS files are still relative to
#     their own locations.
#
#     As a convenience, you may specify paths based on LIB_ROOT in your
#     local DIRS file.  For example
#
#       :foo = $LIB_ROOT/bar
#
#				 Restrictions
#
# NOTE: You cannot assign to :system because it's reserved by ACL2.
#
# NOTE: You cannot have absolute paths for directories in DIRS files.
#
# NOTE: You cannot use "$LIB_ROOT" in the master DIRS file.

<h2>
coi - Computational Object Inference
</h2>

<p>
The coi books comprise a "shelf" of ACL2 books related to the modeling of 
"computational objects" such as processors, memories, kernels, microcode, 
and so on.
</p>

<p>
The term "coi" has at least three interpretations:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
an acronym for "Computational Object Inference".
</li>

<li>
a French word for "quiet" or "silent".  "en rester coi" can be translated as 
"to be left speechless".
</li>

<li>
a deliberate misspelling of koi, Japanese for "carp" (&#x9BC9;).  The koi is 
the mascot of the coi books, and can be seen swimming in a M&#x00F6;bius-strip 
fishbowl in the <a href="coi.jpg">coi logo</a>.  The koi is an apt analogue 
for the coi books, as the koi lurks just below the surface, and keeps 
getting bigger and bigger as it is fed. ;-)
</li>
</ul>

<p>
NB: If "coi" is an offensive word in your native language, many apologies.

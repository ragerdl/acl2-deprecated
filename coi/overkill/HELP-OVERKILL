OVERVIEW

   RAMS includes support for generating ".pcert" files -- provisional
   certificates -- for your books.  These are not full certificates, but they
   do not have any order dependencies so you can "provisionally certify" your
   books in any order, or even in parallel.

   The Overkill system is a simple way to instruct many machines to work on
   generating .pcert files for you in parallel.  You can drastically reduce the
   time it takes to discover errors by using many machines at once to work on
   your certification attempts.

Advice on the use of arithmetic books (based largely on comments from
Robert Krug, and repeated in ../arithmetic-5/README):

  SUMMARY: Power users should include arithmetic-5/top; new users
  should probably instead include arithmetic/top-with-meta.

  Details:

  If you are willing to use dmr (see :doc dmr) and tolerate
  sometimes-slower (but more complete) reasoning, use arithmetic-5.
  Robert is not aware of any rewriting loops.

  Don't use arithmetic-3.  It's not as powerful as arithmetic-5
  (Robert doesn't know if it's faster), and it may have more rewriting
  loops than arithmetic-5.

  Note that arithmetic-2 is totally obsolete.  We may stop
  distributing it.

  If you want fast, lightweight arithmetic, use
  arithmetic/top-with-meta.

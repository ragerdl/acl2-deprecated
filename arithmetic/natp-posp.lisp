; Note: Compound-recognizer rules natp-cr and posp-cr were originally proved
; here for predicates natp and posp.  However, such rules are in the ACL2
; sources starting with ACL2 Version 2.9.2, under the names
; natp-compound-recognizer and posp-compound-recognizer).

<p>For a somewhat heavier and more comprehensive alternative, you may also wish
to see the @(see arith-equivs) book, which introduces, @(see equivalence) relations
like @(see int-equiv) and @(see nat-equiv), and many useful @(see congruence) rules
about these equivalences.</p>"

# This file is a list of certificate files generated by the ACL2
# regression.  It is patterned after regression-targets, but was
# created by running the following in the current (books/) directory
# after making the taspi/ books, e.g. using
#   (time nice make -j 8 ACL2=acl2c)
# and then adding the centaur/doc book at the top below.

# find ./taspi -name '*.cert'

./centaur/doc.cert

<hr>
<b>bstar.lisp</b> - Defines a macro <code>B*</code>, which operates similar to
<code>LET*</code> but supports multiple values, sequential execution for side
effects, and user-defined pattern-based binders.  Here is an example that
illustrates several of its features:<p>
<pre>
(b* ;; let*-like binding to a single variable:
    ((x (cons 'a 'b))
     ;; mv binding
     ((mv y z) (return-two-values x x))
     ;; No binding: expression evaluated for side effects
     (- (cw "Hello")) ;; prints "Hello"
     ;; Dont-care: expression not evaluated at all
     ;; (why do we want this? see below.)
     (& (cw "Hello")) ;; does not print "Hello"
     ;; MV which ignores a value:
     ((mv & a) (return-garbage-in-first-mv y z))
     ;; Pattern-based binding using cons:
     ((cons (cons b c) d) (must-return-nested-conses a))
     ;; Alternate form of pattern binding with cons nests:
     (`(,e (,f . ,g)) (makes-a-list-of-conses b))
     ;; Pattern with user-defined constructor:
     ((my-tuple foo bar hum) (something-of-type-my-tuple e c g))
     ;; Don't-cares with pattern bindings:
     ((my-tuple & (cons carbar &) hum) (something-else foo f hum))
     ;; Pattern inside an mv:
     ((mv a (cons & c)) (make-mv-with-cons)))
  (some-expression ....))
</pre>
User-defined binders can be introduced using <code>DEF-PATBIND-MACRO</code>, as
in the form <pre> (def-patbind-macro cons (car cdr))
</pre> which introduced the binder for cons,
or by defining a macro named <code>PATBIND-<i>&lt;NAME&gt;</i></code>
following the example of the definitions of <code>PATBIND-MV</code>
and <code>PATBIND-LIST</code> in bstar.lisp.
<hr>
<b>pack.lisp</b> - Defines <code>PACK</code>, which takes a term-like object
and makes a symbol that looks like it:<pre>
ACL2 !>(pack '(if a (foo b) (bar c d)))
|(IF A (FOO B) (BAR C D))|
</pre>
<hr>
<b>progndollar.lisp</b> - Defines <code>PROGN$</code>, which evaluates
several forms and returns the value of the last one.  Expands to a
series of nested <code>PROG2$</code>s.
<hr>
<b>cws.lisp</b> - Defines <code>CWS</code>, which prints the values of
a series of forms and returns the value of the last one:<pre>
ACL2 !>(let ((x '(a b c)) (y '(d e f))) (cws x y))
X: (A B C)
Y: (D E F)
(D E F)
</pre>

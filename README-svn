From time to time, we may add new directories.  In that case, steps
described below will explain how to reduce output from the command:

  "svn status -u ."

There are actually two ways to do this.  In most cases, it will be
simplest simply to execute the following in the new directory,
replacing "../unversioned-files.txt" by a path to
unversioned-files.txt in the top-level directory.

  svn propset -R svn:ignore -F unversioned-files.txt .

Otherwise, first execute the following in the top-level directory:

  svn propset -R svn:ignore -F unversioned-files.txt .

Then in each subdirectory with a file unversioned-files-extra.txt,
e.g. as determined by

  find . -name unversioned-files-extra.txt -print

execute the following command, except replacing "../" with an
appropriate number of repetitions of that sequence of three
characters, to obtain a reference to file unversioned-files.txt in the
top-level directory.

  (cat ../unversioned-files.txt unversioned-files-extra.txt > tmp) ; \
  (svn propset svn:ignore -F tmp .) ; \
  (rm tmp)

.....

For the record, here is what was done for the commit creating svn
revision 598.

(a) Added file ./unversioned-files.txt, which simply records the
output of:

  svn propget svn:ignore

(Presumably previous work had been done to set the svn:ignore
property, but now we have the values recorded in
unversioned-files.txt.)

(b) Added files unversioned-files-extra.txt in a few directories, to
specify additional files to ignore, typically ones removed by
extensions of "make clean"in a given directory.

(c) For each such file unversioned-files-extra.txt, executed the above
command starting with "(cat ../unversioned-files.txt", but as above,
replacing "../" with an appropriate number of repetitions of that
sequence of three characters, to obtain a reference to file
unversioned-files.txt in the top-level directory.

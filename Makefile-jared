# Makefile-jared
#
# This is Jared's proposed replacement for books/Makefile using cert.pl.
#
#  - It simplifies the build system, doing away with hundreds of Makefiles in
#    individual directories, and replacing them with this single file.  This is
#    possible because I've gone through and fixed up many books so that they
#    follow certain conventions, explained below.
#
#  - It increases (significantly) opportunities for parallelism, by doing away
#    with directory-level dependencies.  Essentially, any books that do not
#    have an include-book dependency can be built in parallel.  At the same
#    time, this means that books can be reorganized based on their logical
#    content, without regards to directory build order.
#
#  - It generally increases build-system automation.  We use "find" commands to
#    find Lisp files instead of maintaining (by hand) lists of directories.  We
#    also do not need to manually keep track of dependencies between
#    directories, etc.
#
# Basic usage:
#    make -f Makefile-jared -j <jobs> [<target>]
#
# Where:
#    - <jobs> is how many books you want to certify in parallel,
#        typically the number of cores on your machine
#    - <target> is optional and defaults to "all" when omitted,
#        or names the target you want to build (see below).
#
#          (Note: if some day this replaces books/Makefile, the "-f
#           Makefile-jared" part won't be needed.)
#
# Makefile-jared starts by automatically scanning for books and their
# dependencies.  This scanning can be slightly expensive, especially on slow
# NFS systems.  When you know that you haven't added or changed any books, you
# might prefer to avoid rescanning by adding NO_RESCAN=1 to the command line.
#
# In order to make the book- and dependency-scanning simple and reliable, books
# are expected to follow certain conventions.  These conventions are generally
# very similar to the previous behavior of cert.pl and Makefile-generic.
#
#   - We scan for lines like (include-book "foo") and (ld "foo.lisp"); for
#     dependency scanning to work, these commands must be on a single line and
#     can't be wrapped up in macros.  Occasionally it is useful to fool the
#     dependency scanner, e.g., in a multi-line comments you might do:
#
#        #| Here's an example of how to use this stuff:
#
#           (include-book ;; newline to fool dependency scanner
#             "foo")
#
#           (demo-of-how-to-use-foo)
#        |#
#
#   - Additional dependencies (e.g., on raw-lisp files or other kinds of data
#     files) can be added using depends-on comments, e.g.,
#
#        ; (depends-on "foo-raw.lsp")
#
#   - Certifiable books should be named foo.lisp
#   - Non-certifiable Lisp files should be named foo.lsp
#   - The instructions for certifying foo.lisp are found in:
#       foo.acl2, if it exists, or else
#       cert.acl2, if it exists, or else
#       default to simply (certify-book "foo" ? t)
#
# CHANGE/BOZO: In Makefile-jared (as in cert.pl), any certify-book lines given
# in the .acl2 file are ignored.  Instead, we generate the certify-book command
# to use by looking for comments like:
#
#         ; cert-flags: ? t :ttags :all
#
# These comments can be put in the individual foo.acl2 or (for directory-level
# defaults) in cert.acl2.  The default cert-flags are "? t".  Using special
# comments instead of certify-book forms means that the certification flags
# can't be hidden inside macros, possibly easing the job of an "evaluator."
#
# BOZO So far, I have gone through the ACL2 regression suite and replaced
# certify-book lines throughout .acl2 files with cert-flags comments.  However,
# for now I've left the certify-book commands intact, for compatiblity with
# Makefile-generic.  Eventually, we should not have both things in .acl2 files.
# Before we can do that, we'll need to change Makefile-generic to look for
# cert-flags instead of certify-book commands.  Alternately, maybe the scheme
# should be something like: if you give a certify-book command, we use it;
# otherwise we generate one using the cert-flags.


# STATUS / TODO LIST / MISSING FEATURES / BOZOS:
#
#  [DONE] Requires perl on the client machine (I think we've agreed this is
#         okay)
#
#  [DONE] Two-pass certification seems to work, using the cert.pl directive
#         cert_param(acl2x).  See for instance
#         books/make-event/stobj-test.acl2.
#
#  [DONE] How should cleaning work?
#
#    Using a find command has the advantage that it will get rid of old files
#    even after the .lisp files have been deleted.  It has the disadvantage
#    that it seems tricky to properly delete .h and .c files using a find
#    command.  An alternative would be to use CERT_PL_CERTS to generate a huge
#    list of files to remove.  This will require using xargs, etc., which is
#    gross, but so does the find command.  Blah.
#
#    We now implement the CERT_PL_CERTS-based approach, but using clean.pl,
#    which nicely deals with the whole too-many-arguments issue.  It seems to
#    perform well.  I think this is probably as good as we can do.
#
#  [BOZO] Does provisional certification work?
#
#  [BOZO] Add multi-lisp compilation stuff for Matt (might be easy)
#
#  [BOZO] Add support for ACL2(r).  Possibly the right way to do that would be
#         to use something like the $(info Scanning for books...)  sections
#         below, to set up the symlinks, and then just let everything else fall
#         out automatically.

  :short "A slightly enhanced version of @(see defthm)."

  :long "<p>@('defrule') is an drop-in replacement for @('defthm') that
adds:</p>

<ul>

<li>A more concise syntax for @(see acl2::hints) that target
@('\"Goal\"').</li>

<li>A very concise syntax for
@({
  (encapsulate ()
    (local (in-theory (e/d ...)))
    (defthm ...))
})
with @(see acl2::rulesets) integration.</li>

<li>Integration with @(see xdoc).  You can give @(':parents'), @(':short'), and
@(':long') documentation right at the top level of the @('defrule').</li>

</ul>

<h3>Top-level Hints</h3>

<p>You can give @('\"Goal\"') hints directly at the top level of the rule.
For example:</p>

@({
  (defrule repeated-insert           -->  (defthm repeated-insert
    (equal (insert a (insert a X))          (equal (insert a (insert a X))
           (insert a X))                           (insert a X))
    :induct t                               :hints((\"Goal\"
    :expand ((...)))                                :induct t
                                                    :expand ((...))))
})

<p>This works for any hint except for @(':instructions').  If you give
top-level hints and a \"Goal\" hint, the top-level hints will be appended onto
the front of the explicit \"Goal\" hint.</p>

<h3>Theory Support</h3>

<p>Theory hints are especially common.</p>

<p>One option is to just give a top-level @(':in-theory') hint, and it just
gets attached to goal.  But note that such hints are not inherited when you
give an in-theory hint in a subgoal.  This can be quite confusing and
annoying.</p>

<p>As an alternative, @('defrule') also adds top-level @(':enable'),
@(':disable'), and @(':e/d') options.  When you use these keywords, they turn
into a local theory event that is submitted before your defthm.  That way,
they're part of the theory that is inherited by all subgoals.</p>

<p>To make @(':enable'), @(':disable'), and @(':e/d') slightly more powerful,
they are actually integrated with the @(see acl2::rulesets) book.  In
particular, these keywords are always translated into an @(see acl2::e/d*).</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

@({
  (defrule foo            -->  (encapsulate ()
     ...                         (local (in-theory (e/d* (append) (revappend))))
     :enable append              (defthm foo ...))
     :disable revappend)
})

@({
  (defrule bar            -->  (encapsulate ()
     ...                         (local (in-theory (e/d* (append rev)
     :enable (append rev)                                revappend
     :disable revappend                                  (logior)
     :e/d ((logior) (logand)))                           (logand)))
                                 (defthm bar ...))
})")
